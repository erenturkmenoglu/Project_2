You're sitting on 1,000 shares, just biding your time. Your AVG price is $18, or just over two hours of your life spent at Wendy's, per share. Your life savings is in this stock. But you know it's worth it. The Squeezening is nigh. You can smell it in the air. 
 
Your phone buzzes. Your Google Alert for Gamestop tells you that trading is halted on the announcement that Cohen is taking over the company. This is the moment you've been waiting for. You open Robinhood and check your sell orders. You're smart. 
 
Yep, they're set right. 100 shares at $25 and 100 more at $10 increments all the way to $105. You're going to make $70,000. That money will change your life. You can finally go back to school and move out of your mom's basement. You can dump Becky and finally tell her that you don't actually like sitting in the closet and watching her fuck Chad, even if it is the only way she can get off.
 
Trading resumes. You watch the price rise. $30. $48. $70. Your mind and your heart race as you mentally calculate how much money you've made. $115. $130. The squeeze has squoze. You watch the share price trend back down, settling at a respectable $17.04, but that no longer matters to you. You're RICH!  
 
You open Robinhood to see what it feels like to have a five figure account balance. Buying Power: $3.50. There's a message.

10,PLTR - Technical Analysis from a Professional Investor,773,k63z6b,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k63z6b/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/,332,"see my previous analysis on Call options on PLTR, I predicted PLTR would peak, and go down to about 20-22.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k25kax/pltr\_and\_you\_dumb\_money\_guide\_from\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k25kax/pltr_and_you_dumb_money_guide_from_professional/)

pricing on these options started making sense yesterday and I loaded up on calls. You have possibly upward sloping call delta for returns that are 50%+. While this is pricey, it is where options were when PLTR was about 20 bucks last time. This tells me selling pressure is near exhaustion.

As other people have mentioned, we have hit the long term trend line and have bounced off of that. I see one more retest of the trend line before we go back up. ~~Now we haven't hit the 38% retracement level of 32, which is around 20. So there is a chance we may go down to 20 before going back up~~. (Thanks  [brandimore](https://www.reddit.com/user/jbrandimore/)). We have hit the 38 retracement level at 22, which is also the long term trend support. So the risk ~~retard~~ reward is quite attractive now.

I see a move into near 38-42 by the end of the year. We saw similar moves by Nio and Tesla in the earlier part of their large 10x run-ups. I think there is a high likelihood the run-up for PLTR is only beginning. Based on sentiments on WSB, i see another 3-7 days of consolidation around 22-25 to shake out the week hands as well as burn off the 12/4 and 12/11 options before we will see a continuation of the upward trend.

25,Why GME gonna moon,96,k6a3in,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6a3in/why_gme_gonna_moon/,51,"Simple TA for simple people, by a simple person, who learned everything in 15 mins, so obvs listen to my advice.

1. Cup and handle pattern = stock will moon. Don't ask me why, apparently it's a thing.
2. We're pretty far above the moving average (purple line), which shows great strength in the imminent rebound
3. We've tested the support several times (meaning the stock price touches the purple line but doesn't go below) and we passed the test (meaning peeps have confidence stocks won't tank)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2xnd7lpyd2361.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=64b7a3e4dbadf4d4b1acb713969c3b4ea66be650

4. Short interest currently at 137%, meaning people shorted many more stocks than there are actual stocks to buy back. This number, 137%, is very significant and unheard of. Meaning when the stocks keep rising, all those who shorted the stock have to fight that much harder to buy shares back to cover their shorts, leading to a short squeeze. [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

&#x200B;

5. No, the short squeeze isn't ""over"". If you look at the volume of shares shorted, it's literally increasing. If the shorts are covering their position, you'd see a lower volume of shares shorted. Why are they shorting more instead of just buying back? They short to drive prices down to cause people to panic and sell, which drives prices more down, so they can cover their short position and buy back cheap shares from all the paper hand retail investors. They have confidence we will fold and sell, and judging from all the paper hands selling PLTR from just a single Citron report, maybe they're right.

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)

&#x200B;

6. I've spent like 15 minutes learning and I see this much. You can bet the shorters, who know so much more than me, aren't sleeping at night these days. And you can bet there are whale longs out there trying to start this squeeze as well. We're just shrimp for the ride, as another autist had said in a comment somewhere else. This is a perfect short squeeze set up. Everyone knows this. This WILL happen.

&#x200B;

My 4 shares gonna moon.

&#x200B;

TL;DR = just another GME mooning post, but hopefully explained in a more noob way, cuz im noob  
TLDRTLDR =   üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ



Bonus edit: maybe some of you are wondering how to play the short squeeze. I spent a whole five minutes researching, and found out there's this thing called ""days to cover"", which is some number that's calculated by smart people, and it tells you the average number of days in order for all the shorts to be able to cover their position. Last time I checked the days to cover for gme is like 5.7 ish, which means the shorts will need to spend at least 5.7 days of buying stocks in order to buy back enough to cover their shorts, based on current average stock movement volume. 

What does this mean? It means the prices will be going up for days before the peak. Meaning if you sell within the first day of the squeeze, you'll regret it, but also your sale will contribute to stunting the growth of the mooning stock peen, so shame on you for selling within the first day. Hold for a couple of days and see triple digits hopefully.

And no, I was lying that I had 4 shares. I actually have 20, bought at $19, the most autistic entry point possible because I'm an expert. The 4 is symbolic of how fucking poor I am."

I think this is the wrong strategy. For those of you who may not know, when there is a dividend on a stock sold short, the short seller must pay it to the person they're borrowing from.

If management declares a dividend policy targeting 50% of future FCF, I believe GME stock would quickly appreciate to its Fair Market Value (FMV) on a DCF valuation model. If management also lays out a plan for the long term evolution of the company, that valuation model would rise significantly. But the dividend is what would convince the market of the fair value of GME shares.

Boy has it been an ugly 7 day bloodbath for BestBuy. The kind of red river flow that makes you second guess taking the dirt road home. But man have I been waiting for this moment.

*Currently $106.50 a share*

The answer is simple: buy, and buy fast.. and here is why:

1. Their Q3 sales were knock out. 22% increase from Q3‚Äô19 and 173.7% increase in online orders.

2. Their dividend was just increased to .55cents per share. (must own stock before 12/14. Dividend payout is early January.

3. JPMorgan just upped their price target from $115 to $124.

4. Their 3 month RSI is extremely low. Hovering around 31..the company is ridiculously oversold right now. 

5. Their market cap is $28B and they do $40B in revenue each year. TDAmeritrade has them marked extremely low with a P/E ratio of 15

6. The Holliday season is here and electronics are the new sliced bread. Within the next two weeks I can realistically see it running $8-10 higher.

7. I‚Äôm not sure about you, but the BestBuy where I live (Connecticut) is consistently packed. Good products, inventory and an established brand.

But I‚Äôll leave it at that for now. Keeping the list at a lucky 7 in hopes for a Jackpot. Check out the chart and further your DD if this post sparked any curiosity. 

(Keep in mind I am extremely bias, for as I have my balls on the line with this. And 55 calls that expire in January.. So a decently high risk.. On a scale of ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt make a difference if they expire - to - I‚Äôll be hanging in the rafters‚Äù I‚Äôm probably like a ‚Äúwill be slightly depressed for a day or two, and gaze out the window with a melancholic stare while listening to All You Wanted by Michelle Branch.‚Äù

I'm talkin about V G A C

&#x200B;

**VIRGIN GROUP'S ACQUISITION CORP**

This is my boy *Richard Branson's* SPAC and he is actively trying to get in on the EV hype. If this ticker turns out anything like his other love child, SPCE, we can pretty much count on a one-way trip to the moon. He's been on the EV hype train for quite a while and the current EV goldrush seems to have created the perfect storm. His SPAC had an initial public offering of $480,000,000.

""Virgin boss Richard Branson is about to go head-to-head with Tesla‚Äôs Elon Musk by adding an electric vehicle to the brand‚Äôs already extensive portfolio.

During an interview with Bloomberg TV, Branson said that he has a team working on developing an electric vehicle for the mass market, which would rival Tesla. This statement was released during the Formula E event in Miami. The billionaire said that Virgin might compete with Tesla in the electric car business in the future.

Virgin has already developed an electric car, which is currently competing in the electric version of the world's premiere racing competition Formula 1. Formula E uses a more defined and well-engineered electric motor similar to its counterparts in Formula 1.""

Now we all know the key to SPACs is to get in on the ground floor. Why? Because minimal risk, that's why. This SPAC is currently trading at the bargain price of 10.40 thanks to that lovely little market crash we had over the last couple of days.

**Which company is Branson's SPAC merging with?**

Speculation on speculation. The most prominent rumor floating around the SPACiverse is that they will be working with the company Envision.

[http://www.envision-group.com/en/formulae.html](http://www.envision-group.com/en/formulae.html)

Go check the website. They have their fingers in practically every part of the renewable energy sector.

I'm a little retarded so I have no idea if this SPAC has already been talked about on WSB, but it's only just getting picked up by the Youtube stock influencers. My game plan is to get in ""early"" before *all* the influencers pick it up.

If anything, this is a great ticker to park some cash while we wait for news. The headline ""Branson is about to go head-to-head with Tesla's Elon Musk"" should be enough to make this move. It's just a matter of when.

Richard Branson's EV SPAC. Huge Potential, Limited risk. Get in before all the ""Social Media Influencers"" start talking about it."
71,GME Squeeze Double Dip,24,k6agpd,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6agpd/gme_squeeze_double_dip/,39,"Scenario:

You're holding 1,000 GME shares you bought at $18. GME starts climbing to 100, then 150. Let's say 200. You buy 10 protective puts 4 months out at 175 to lock in your profit against it gapping down and put a stop loss in at 185 for inter day trading. If it hits your stop loss and you sell at 185. You're now sitting on 10 puts at a strike of $175 good for 4 months. During that time GME drops back down to $18 and you buy 1,000 shares again to exercise your 10 puts to sell at 175, effectively double dipping the squeeze.

Would that work?"

They have issued stock to the tune of diluting there shares from 117M to 137M. Ohh wait, that's what they did last month. This month they are issuing 10 times as many - **200M SHARES**. Going to **337M Shares**!

[109M on 9/30](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/shares_outstanding) to 337 M is a 300% increase in stock. It's like owning 1/3 as much of a company as you did a couple months ago.

They know there price will tank as these sell off, they have to sell them as quickly as possible. This will push share prices down to the $2 level within the next two weeks. No investor wants this to happen to a company.

\[b\]Now wait, doesn't this just mean that the company will be bigger and more profitable?\[/b\]

No - A normal stock issue isn't that detrimental to a company, they issue stock, get more money, and use that money to improve the company. But in this case they are spending this money at a burn rate of [200M+ a Month](https://deadline.com/2020/10/amc-entertainment-3q-sales-at-119m-had-419m-in-cash-as-of-sept-30-plans-to-sell-more-stock-to-raise-cash-1234600263/)

They will raise 100M - 500M off of this stock sale, and burn through it in less then 3 months, being no better off then they were three months previous, no better product, same old theaters, nothing will change, but they will have spent all the money they raised paying debtors, rent, employees, utils.

\[b\]But isn't the bottom already here? They lost 16% today\[/b\]

I don't believe they have been able to sell many shares yet. It will take them a couple weeks to sell that many shares. Plus they have had other bad news today.

Warner Bros. says [Movie Theaters be Fucked](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/business/media/warner-brothers-movies-release-streaming.html)

\[b\]They have 6B in Debt\[/b\], they obviously can't get any more loans, otherwise they never would have issues a 200M shares. At their expected burn rate the last three months they must be almost out of cash.

Their expenses, loan payments, and rent payments are way to high to continue for 6 months of almost non existent movie attendance.

**Isn't moviegoing attendance turning around? - No.**

[Weekend movie sales are hovering around 11M](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/?ref_=bo_nb_hm_secondarytab) This is down from an average of 220M.

AMC holds about 72% of the market share, they get to keep about [50% of ticket sales](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/b23298d4-61c9-4028-9103-b652338c303f.html#AMC-20191231X10K_HTM_ITEM6SELECTEDFINANCIALDATA_712989), and concession sales top out at 50% of ticket sales, this gives them monthly income of $35M and they have 80% of their theaters open to get that much income, they have to pay utilities and employees at about 800 theaters in order to get that 45 Million.

Last year they had 40k employees (mostly part time) Even if they only need 1/3 of that number, at $14 an hour, at 30 hours a week average, that comes to 25M a month. Rent is 80M / Month, interest is at least $25M / Month

Even with the best possible cost cutting, even if their loans become interest free for a year, they will lose 150M a month until attendance is at 2019 levels.

\[b\]But won't the debtors renegotiate? Give them more loans?\[/b\]

Here is the rub. They have assets to cover a good portion of their debt. They have 2.7B in property. They also have 4.7B in lease right of use. This will cover a good portion of their debt. Debtors may be thinking that it is better to rip off the Band-Aid now, and resell the theaters and property, then to have them depreciate another year and have assets sold off to pay the rent at a 200M+ burn rate.

\[b\]They are poised for a bankruptcy, and this stock sale proves it.\[/b\]

We have seen another company slowly die through stock dilution sales in the movie sector- **MOVIEPASS.**

You might be asking: How does this help me - Buy Puts, sell calls, short shares, exit upward positions. All investors will be looking to escape this loser.

Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC, -15.97% dropped 1.9% in premarket trading Thursday, after the movie theater operator filed for the sale of up to 200.0 million Class A shares. Based on Wednesday's stock closing price of $4.32, the offering could be worth up to $864 million, which compares with AMC's market capitalization of $593.5 million. AMC said it may sell the shares from time to time, in one or more series or issuances, and on terms that will be determined at the time of the offering. The company said it had 85.6 million Class A shares and 51.8 million Class B shares outstanding as of Oct. 30. The stock has dropped 34.6% over the past three months through Wednesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.06% has gained 6.2%.

&#x200B;

Edit:

**Someone will just buy em, right?**

They were perfect for a buyout before issuing 200M shares (besides the 5.5B Debt), but no company will buy something so diluted until the price plummets to 1/3 of what it was.

It would cost a company 2 -3x what they would have spent last week to buy the same % of the company at current share prices.

I'm back with a second post explaining option things.  I was overwhelmed by the positive feedback from the first post, which can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2a2j8/options_explained_a_quick_beginners_guide/).  Before proceeding, you need to have a fundamental understanding of the following topics (if you can answer these questions you're set):

* What is a call/put?
* What is the difference between Selling to Open and Buying to Open? Which has more inherent risk and why?
* What are At the Money/In the Money/Out of the Money for both calls and puts?
* What is intrinsic value?
* What is extrinsic value?

If you can't answer any of these please read the first post or simply Google/YouTube the things you do not understand.  If you are really struggling with any of them and you've tried these resources please don't hesitate to message me or ask your question in the comments of the first post.

In this post, we are going to cover:

* Credit vs. Debit
* Selling Covered Calls vs. Naked Calls
* Cost Basis
* Selling Cash Secured Puts
* Debit Spreads

Grab your phone, open up your brokerage, and follow along.  I encourage the consumption of bourbon on the rocks and the listening of Mac Miller during the reading of this post.

***Credit vs. Debit***

* Credit - any money that a trader **collects** as a result of selling an option.  For selling calls/puts, if the seller places an Ask and the order gets filled, they will be credited with the money, meaning that it will immediately be placed into your account.
* Debit - any money that a trader **pays** as a result of buying an option.  For buying calls/puts, if the buyer places a Bid and the order gets filled, they ill pay the money for that option, and now they own that option.

***Selling Covered Calls vs. Naked Calls***

Covered calls are an option strategy where the trader uses 100 shares of the underlying as collateral to sell calls.  The sold calls should be out of the money and always needs to be above the cost basis of the owned stock to avoid loss.  This is a safer strategy than selling naked calls (selling a call when you do NOT own 100 shares of the underlying) because if the price of the stock breaks through the strike price and the buyer exercises you will not realize an immediate loss by buying shares above the strike and selling them for the strike.  Lots of words, lets take a look.  I, again, am going to use $MSFT as an example.  This is only an example, any sentiment towards this stock expressed is solely hypothetical.

We're neutral to bearish on $MSFT and don't think there will be any significant price spikes in the underlying.  We'll look at selling naked calls first.  Below is the 12/31 options chain for $MSFT Calls.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3ogjfcs7iw261.jpg?width=885&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b2cc8b36f737034b0f1945b8b5f46d4e72bc8b2

We think $MSFT is going to trade sideways or decrease in value, so we are going to sell the 12/31 $220.0C.  You put in an ask for $4.05 and it is filled, so that $4.05 is technically immediately credited into your account.  Robinhood will not immediately show this in your account because it is an open contract but as the option price changes those changes will be reflected on your daily P/L chart.

* Best case scenario for you: $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, resulting in the option decreasing in value.  At any point when the option is under the price you paid for it you could Buy to Close the call and that would be your realized profit.  For example, on 12/15 $MSFT is trading at $200.0, the call is now worth $2.05, so you could buy to close your contract and your gain would be $4.05 - $2.05 = $2.00, or $200.
* Worst case scenario: You go to sleep in the evening, smiling because you think you made an easy $4.05, you've figured out how to beat the market.  BUT $MSFT announces that it has been contracted by NASA to put computers on the Moon.  $MSFT rockets up to $300.  The person that bought your calls decides to exercise, this means that you would have to BUY 100 shares of $MSFT at the current market price and sell them at the strike price, or $220.0. Your max loss would be \[($300 - $220) x 100\] - $405 = $7,595.0.  If the price went higher or you had more than 1 open contract you could see how this is insane risk.  THIS IS WHY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT SELLING NAKED CALLS.

Covered Calls - Now lets say we have 100 shares of $MSFT that we bought during a dip at $205.0.  We are bullish on the stock and are holding long but don't think that it will go to $220.0 from $214.0 so we sell the same call.  Again, the money is *credited* to the account.

* Best case scenario the stock finishes just below the strike on the expiration date and you can sell another call further out for more premium.  If the stock is at $219.0 on the day of expiration, you can just sell a $230.0 call further out and collect more premium.  You can continue this until you are assigned the stock.
* Worst case? The underlying goes through the strike to $225.  Your total gains for the trade would be \[($220.0 - $205.) x100\] + $405 = $1,905.0.  Now, if you hadn't sold the call you would have realized more gains if you sold the 100 shares at $225, but only by $95.  ***THE IMPORTANT PART IS THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE 100 SHARES AS COLLATERAL YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THEM AT THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE.***

***Cost Basis***

* Cost basis is the price you paid for a stock minus any credit you have received for selling covered calls, receiving dividends, etc.  This is done at the single stock level.
* Example:
   * We buy 100 shares of $WSB at $100.0 per share
   * We Sell to Open an OTM Covered Call on $WSB for $1.00.
   * Our 50% profit trigger is hit, and we Buy to Close the contract at $.50.
   * Our new cost basis is ($100.0 - $.50 = $99.5)
   * We Sell to Open another OTM Covered Call on $WSB for $1.00, but this time we let it expire worthless.  Our new cost basis is ($99.5 - $1.0 = $98.5).

Cost Basis is important when selling covered calls because you should not sell covered calls for a strike price that is less than your cost basis.

* Example: Our cost basis on $WSB after a few CCs is now $90.0 and is trading at $110.0
* $WSB takes a little nose dive with the market and falls to $80.0.  If we sell an $85.0 CC for $1.00, we reduce our Cost Basis to $89.0, but if we are assigned, we realize a total loss of $400.0 if the stock finishes anywhere above the strike price and is exercised.

***Selling Cash Secured Puts***

The risk associated with selling naked puts is the same as selling naked calls, but reverse.  If you sell a put, the stock tanks, you are now obligated to buy from the owner of the option the stock on the higher price than market.  For example, you sell a $20 put, the stock falls to $10 and the owner decides to exercise the option, you are now OBLIGATED to buy 100 shares at $20.0, when they are selling on the open market for $10. Your loss would therefore be \[(20.0-10.0) \* 100\] - credited premium = Max Loss.

Selling a cash secured put is selling a put with an adequate amount of cash available to buy the shares if the underlying does drop below the strike and the option is exercised.

Suppose we are neutral to bullish on $MSFT so want to collect premium by selling a put.  Look at the option chain for 12/31 $MSFT below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uk00p9qj3w261.jpg?width=882&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e785e8ae40260339e52dc44034187fbc63551e9

We can sell the $MSFT 12/31 $205.0P and be credited $2.41, or $241.0.  There are a few things that can happen.  When you do this, you will need $20,500 to be a cash secured put. (Strike Price \* 100 = Necessary Collateral)

* The price of the underlying goes up, and the seller of the option (us) can *Buy to Close* the contract.  We have no further obligation to sell any shares at the strike price and the money that was held for collateral is released.  The profit of the contract is simply the difference in the premium when we Sold to Open and the now lower premium when we Buy to Close.
* The price of the underlying trades sideways.  This will result in theta decay of the option and we can Buy to Close once we hit our desired exit price or % gain.
* The price of the underlying drops below the strike price.  If this happens you can:
   * Buy to Close at a loss to release your collateral.  This might be a significant loss
   * Be assigned the stock.  By doing so you have now aggressively entered $MSFT at a lower price than it was on the day you sold the OTM Put.  As soon as you get assigned the shares, guess what we can do?  Sell to Open a Covered Call

Some quick notes on the CSP, you should only sell CSPs on stocks you are comfortable with being assigned and ones that you are bullish on.

Selling CSPs and CCs are the fundamentals of doing a strategy called the wheel, but not a strategy I am going to get into with this post.

***Debit Spreads***

Debit spreads are a way to bet on the directional movement of a stock while reducing both your maximum loss and your potential profit.

*Call Debit Spreads*

This is done by Buying to Open a call while Selling to Open a call with a higher strike price.  This allows us to use the credit received from Selling to Open (-1) contract to help lower the cost of the option we Buy to Open (+1).  Look at the $MSFT 12/31 options chain below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k20t4uy48w261.jpg?width=888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cde6714f5d20c7a86651e713b226fbfe4f0b624f

We want to Buy to Open the $MSFT 12/31 $220.0 call, which would cost us $4.15 if we do not use a debit spread.  BUT if we simultaneously Sell to Open the $225.0C for $2.56, we can lower the DEBIT we would need to open this trade.

1. This lowers the debit we need to pay for our trade from $4.15 to ($4.15 - $2.56 = **$1.59**)
2. This limits our max profit we can receive from the trade to the difference in the strike prices, so \[($225.0 - $220.0) \* 100\] - $159 = $341.

Check out this example put into Robinhood desktop below.

Notice my absolutely God Awful drawings.  We need to confirm that we have selected the right strike prices on the right expiration, and that we are DEFINITELY Buying to Open the lower strike and Selling to Open the further OTM higher strike. Robinhood helps us autists by putting a ""Call Debit Spread"" by our order.  If it says anything but this, you fucked up.  Notice circle 2, where we can see the strikes of the Calls we have chosen to Buy/Sell.  Below is what it looks like in mobile.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3y4e47tlew261.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c87ee245fac4ac48067bb8ea8c7b4d10612218a

Below is a P/L chart I created with [optioncreator.com](https://optioncreator.com).  This chart is only applicable on the day of expiration and will change depending on DTE and volatility.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ivge56pwew261.jpg?width=1407&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44946041b92c31004c74fb4807d95cb7f1e2bb0e

Notice how our max loss is realized until the stock price passes through our long call, increases, then it flattens out and is capped regardless of the price of the underlying at our max profit at stock prices $225.0 and beyond.

*Put Debit Spreads*

The process is exactly the same but inverted.  You are Buying to Open a put and Selling to Open a put with a lower strike price, but the principles are all the same.  If you don't understand this, let me know and I can type out a full example like the one above.

***Conclusion***

I hope that this in addition to the first one have been helpful.  I think these strategies will give everyone on this sub an advantage over the house we are trying to beat.  Again, best of luck.  Trade well.  Trade with passion.  YOLO but YOLO smart.

P.S.  Due to the positive response from last one I will continue to create these until told to royally fuck off.  I am also creating a YouTube to explain these as best as I can and share my portfolio and my trading strategy.  If you're interested in seeing them send me a message and I'll send it out when its off the ground.  I will not solicit on this page ever.

If you are smarter than me and find errors (which I'm sure there are) comment so I can fix.

Rolls Royce was in the middle of restructuring after writing down hundreds of millions of dollars due to unanticipated maintenance issues on their Trent 1000 jet engines (common on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner) when coronavirus hit and totally demolished the market for jet engines.

Additionally Brexit plus aggressive, reactionary Chinese foreign policy has impacted their ability to compete in many of the largest markets.

They have laid off thousands and were forced to raise a significant amount of capital. 

Buying now may be great for a slow climb to significant gains.

1. As both a major defense contractor and employer, the British government is unlikely to allow Rolls-Royce to go into bankruptcy (receivership is europoor English).

2. As the whole market knows, were on the back end of the virus saga and the jet engine market will start climbing out of this hole in the coming year.

3. [Hard Brexit is here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-02/supply-chains-latest-rotterdam-s-port-braces-for-brexit-chaos) Britain is about to start negotiating new trade deals that will prove to be nothing but positive catalysts for beaten down RYCEY.

4. Rolls-Royce sold their nuclear maintenance unit but kept their modular reactor program. They are leading a consortium that is [set to get significant funds from British, French and possibly other clients.](https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/UK-commits-funding-to-Rolls-Royce-SMR)

It would give vital support for the strategy of Rolls-Royce, a prominent UK manufacturer, of developing new revenue streams to reduce its reliance on the civil aerospace sector, which has been devastated¬†by the Covid-19 pandemic.‚Äô](https://www.ft.com/content/d7016b80-e0c4-4444-a059-2daf32b9a4ab)

6. The new Trent UltraFan currently in testing is projected to offer 25% fuel savings and will be hitting the market just in time as it will take a while for aircraft manufacturers to start seeing big demand again. (Tired of linking shit, just google it.)

7. Lastly, as a major defense contractor and the designer of the new F35 VTOL powertrain and the engine builder for Britain‚Äôs 6th gen jet fighter ‚ÄòTempest‚Äô scheduled for 2035 they have a major revenue stream not impacted by COVID-19 and likely to benefit from increased militarization of European countries (Sweden and Italy are already in the tempest project with GB)

**Major upside expected in the next 6-12 months with $FNMA---**

**Tldr:** This stock currently trades at **$2.50** and has gigantic upside in the next 12 months. The supreme court will hear arguments on December 9th challenging the government‚Äôs legal right to take over the company (hugely conservative court now that always vote against gov takeovers) AND Trump has gotten the ball rolling on doing it through the treasury with intent to do it before the Biden Inauguration. **Likely upside potential if either of these things happens = stock rises to $8-10.**

**Again this company is huge with a 2019 net income of $14.2B**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright you clowns, listen up. Incredibly strategic play here on Fannie Mae. Ever heard of it? Good.

This DD will give an easily  comprehensible  overview of FNMA and why this play is super compelling.

The Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as **Fannie Mae**, is a United States government-sponsored enterprise founded in the 1930‚Äôs and, since 1968, a publicly traded company. The purpose of Fannie Mae is to expand the secondary mortgage market by securitizing mortgage loans in the form of mortgage-backed securities, allowing lenders to reinvest their assets into more lending and in effect increasing the number of lenders in the mortgage market.

In other words, they basically buy mortgages (middle class people mortgages) from banks and chop them up in tiny pieces by issuing securities that are backed by them and then guarantee those securities. Basically, they are an insurer of super low risk assets.

Now this all may sound familiar and if mortgage-back securities sound familiar then you probably saw The Big Short or know a thing or two about the housing and financial crisis in 2008-2010. In the lead up to the housing crash, FNMA blew up because they were inadequately capitalized and started buying subprime mortgages (the big short explains this all well actually).

Following the housing crisis in 2008, Fannie Mae fell victim to a complete government takeover and the stock died. Shortly before the 2008 election, FNMA was place into conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. So basically, the government took FNMA over and injected a gigantic amount of money and capital into it.

In 2010, FNMA announced their stocks would be delisted from the NYSE. The Federal Housing Finance Agency directed the delisting after Fannie's stock traded below $1 a share for over 30 days. Since then the stocks have continued to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.

So, what was the outcome? At the time of the takeover, FNMA was written off and many believed it was destined for insolvency. But interestingly, the opposite happened. **In the years that followed, FNMA built capital and re-paid the loans back to the government with over 10% interest.**

Politics got in the way, however, and the Obama Admin refused to privatize the company and allow it to hit the normal markets again. The trump admin, however, was very interested in ending the games and removing government control, privatizing the company, and allowing it to re-list again on NYSE. Many of the bureaucratic steps necessary for this have already happened.

**This is where the timing of this buy is simply incredible. There are two upcoming decision points and a lot of context that make it likely this stock moons in the next 6 months.**

1. The Trump admin has 2 months remaining and some insiders believe strongly (and this is corroborated by the fact much of the leg work has been done) that they will make this deal prior to Biden being inaugurated. Trump treasury secretary has a particular fascination with this given his wall street background and wants to get the deal done.

**2) Secondly, and perhaps most important, is that on** ***December 9th***\*\*\*\*, the Supreme Court of the United States with hear a case as to whether or not the government expropriation of FNMA is legal or not.\*\* This again, is very important. The supreme court has changed dramatically in recent weeks and years and is now solidly a 6-3 heavily conservative court.\*\* Conservative courts are notorious for ruling against government take-over of private companies. The fact the court is hearing this case so soon after the most recent judge‚Äôs confirmation is likely telling (the court itself votes on which cases on appeal to even hear).

3) If either of these two things results in positive news for the reversal of the government involvement in this stock, insiders, including the **SPACMAN Bill Ackman** (whose holding company holds a big chunk of FNMA purchase in 2013 at around the current $2.50 price) believe that the stock will be guaranteed to rise by as much as 6X and at a minimum 2-3X. There would also likely be know delay in this rise, given how gigantic these companies are.

4) Finally, regardless of whether Trump or the Supreme Court makes this happen, things are on track for the change to take place under Biden in any case, it just may not be as quick and may happen sometime later in 2021.

Fund managers are accumulating shares now so they won't have to buy them later at a higher price. This is great for call holders now because it is driving the price up.

Now, I believe the same type of crush will happen after the inclusion date as we saw after the merger date. Maybe a couple of days of elation after Dec21st but the irrational exuberance will subside and then, puts will print tendies.

I only write because I despise **those trolls who spread fake information for their own benefit**. Even if a couple of people who read my post can avoid the pitfall of being conned, my effort is not wasted.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is this ‚ÄúKennedy-Von Hollen bill‚Äù about?**

Congress established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to inspect audits of public companies. Currently, **Chinese government refuses to allow the PCAOB to inspect audits of companies registered in China and Hong Kong**. This led to the massive scandal and eventual delisting of Luckin Coffee. The Kennedy-Von Hollen bill aims to prohibit securities of a company from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges if the company has failed to comply with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board‚Äôs (PCAOB) audits for three years in a row.

**Source**: Government website [https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 1: This bill does not apply to companies like $BABA or $NIO, because they are already using American auditors.**

**BUSTED**. For example, $NIO uses PricewaterhouseCoopers **Zhong Tian LLP**, which is a **China-based** auditor. **PCAOB currently CANNOT inspect audits from $NIO, or $BABA, or many other Chinese companies**.

**Source**: the **official PCAOB website** where you can find that $NIO is listed as a DENIED ISSUER AUDIT CLIENT

[https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/denied-access-to-inspections?searchWithin=NIO](https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/denied-access-to-inspections?searchWithin=NIO)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 2: PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP is registered with PCAOB. This means PCAOB is able to inspect $NIO‚Äôs audits.**

**BUSTED**. An accounting firm being registered with PCAOB **does NOT mean its audits can be inspected**. (To be honest I am quite surprised the internet trolls can dig this far in order to twist facts. They even know the firm is registered. Wow.)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 3: Whether Trump signs this bill or not does not matter at all, because he will soon leave the White House.**

**BUSTED**. Trump is still the president. After the bill passes both Senate and House, **if president signs, the bill becomes a legislation and will be enforced**. Unless this bill gets repealed after Biden takes over, it will have a lasting impact. And since this bill has gained **unanimous bipartisan support**, it is highly unlikely that the bill will be repealed.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 4: Because Trump‚Äôs TikTok ban hasn‚Äôt been successful so far, the Chinese stock delisting bill will not be enforced either.**

**BUSTED**. These are totally different matters. Trump‚Äôs TikTok ban is an **executive order**, **not a law**. Executive orders can be overturned by judges. Whereas, if the Kennedy-Von Hollen bill is signed by Trump, it will become **legislation**.

If anything this tells you, **China did NOT prevent TikTok's US operation from being sold to Oracle. It won't be a surprise if eventually they will NOT prevent from these stocks being delisted.**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 5: This bill is fake, because it is passed by Senate first and House second. Real bills get passed in House first.**

**BUSTED**. God, I am so disappointed in the new generation‚Äôs understanding of our own government. **Senate bill, proposed by senators, will be voted in the Senate first**. And since this bill is proposed by Senator John Kennedy and Senator Chris Van Hollen, this is a Senate bill. (As an American citizen, **please try to understand how our own government works**)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 6: $NIO spokeswoman says they have become compliant over the past few months, which means $NIO will not be subject to this bill.**

**PROBABLY INACCURATE**. They can only ‚Äú**TRY**‚Äù to comply with the regulations, but whether they ‚Äú**CAN**‚Äù is **not really up to them**. **It is NOT the companies themselves that are against the inspection of audits, it is the Chinese government.**

**Source**: the damn SEC chairman Jay Clayton himself [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other)

‚Äú**China‚Äôs state security laws are invoked** at times to limit U.S. regulators‚Äô ability to oversee the financial reporting of U.S.-listed, China-based companies. In particular, **Chinese laws governing the protection of state secrets and national security have been invoked to limit foreign access to China-based business books and records and audit work papers**.‚Äù

It is outside companies‚Äô power to comply with US regulations, because the issue concerns Chinese state security law. **You think these companies will disobey Chinese state security laws just to comply with US listing rules?** If the Chinese government says No, there will be no way they can be compliant, no matter how they ‚Äú**TRY**‚Äù.

**Source**: another Chinese EV maker $LI even mentioned such uncertainty in its SEC filing.

‚Äúthe adoption of any rules, legislations or other efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information could cause uncertainty, and **we could be delisted if we are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time**‚Äù

They may not, but they **COULD**.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 7: The Chinese will make compromise to avoid delisting, because they are weaklings and they always make concessions to the US.**

**UNCERTAIN**. I can‚Äôt imagine how people can just go around vouching this as a fact. Do they work for the Chinese government? Are they the officials responsible for the negotiations? How can this be a certainty already?

If you bet that the Chinese will make compromises, **you are basically betting that Chinese will back down from its own state security law**. **It is possible that they will, but it‚Äôs far from certainty**. They have not compromised on an ‚Äúindependent investigation of coronavirus origin‚Äù in Wuhan. They have not compromised on the National Security Law enacted in Hong Kong. How on earth can you be so sure that they will compromise on their own state security law?

The negotiation on PCAOB inspection between the US and China has taken 10 years. China has not yet compromised in the past 10 years. But now suddenly they will just yield? Is this really logical thinking, or **purely your imagination?**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

Can these Chinese stocks go up? Not impossible. Can they go down? Also possible. Whether you buy or sell, consider the risks, and **don‚Äôt get manipulated by those who are spreading lies for their own benefit.**"

146,MU,6,k6ayoq,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6ayoq/mu/,11,"I guess this is a DD, but it's way too casual to be a DD. For one, I don't have access to all the data. But, it seems like I've spotted a consistent pattern.

MU is one of the largest memory chip manufacturers in the world, up there Samsung, Texas Instruments, and other brands. You're likely using RAM and storage devices built by them. MU has two market brands: Crucial (high-performance premium brand) and Lexar (causal and portable storage brand). They also manufacture large volumes of off-label products for other manufacturers like Corsair. 

It seems that their stock price has a consistent pattern. It becomes very bullish around November, which coincides with a large increase in manufacturing ahead of the holiday season. Of course, people are buying iPhones and other electronic products in time for the holidays. The spike in price continues through December and tapers off by February.

In March, the price becomes volatile. I'm not certain why that's the case, but I think it may have to do with the large numbers of Android phone releases in spring. When Samsung releases a phone, if people end up buying those more than the competition, since Samsung uses their own memory chips, MU loses future business. If other brands take the lead, MU needs to ramp up production to meet demand.

June is where this stock begins to drop substantially. I'm not sure why this is and can't find any sources or deducible causes, but it's been the case. June 2018 and June 2020 are some of the most profound bearish periods for MU. However, June seems consistently bearish.

Around September, the stock ends its bearish and volatile stages. In this time, the stock becomes very neutral, leaning bearish. One would expect the back-to-school season in North America to drive up the stock price, but it doesn't. Perhaps the reason is due to MU targeting the high-end and the mainstream rather than the broad middle market for storage chips. The former obviously resonates with holiday buyers and the latter is not a frequent purchase, meaning despite the increases in electronics purchases, people are likely not purchasing MU products specifically.

Overall, for a reasonable long-term strategy, one can alternate between theta gang and YOLO. Mid-October is the time to load up on calls ahead of the Nov-Dec spike. Once January comes, straddles for April strikes are ideal, and this can be played against expectations for Samsung's smartphone releases since Samsung is the one major company to not use MU products in their smartphones. May and June are good for bearish plays, but the bearish periods are lesser in magnitude compared to the bulls. September is the time to put exercised shares towards iron condors or covered calls. 

tl;dr : MU calls for Dec-Jan strikes, straddles for April strike, puts for August strike, iron condors Sept-Oct, rinse, repeat."

Ive seen elon blasting LiDar tech saying its trash:
https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/

""They're all going to dump lidar,"" Elon Musk said at an April event showcasing Tesla's self-driving technology. ""Anyone relying on lidar is doomed.""

""Lidar is really a shortcut,"" added Tesla AI guru Andrej Karpathy. ""It sidesteps the fundamental problems of visual recognition that is necessary for autonomy. It gives a false sense of progress, and is ultimately a crutch.""

But also a bunch of companies are using it, considering even the fucking army uses it:
https://idstch.com/technology/photonics/military-applications-lidar/

""by combining the laser range, laser scan angle, laser position from GPS, and laser orientation from Inertial Navigation System. Additional information about the object, like its velocity or material composition, can also be determined by measuring cert""

Again i have shares in LAZR and i am probably going to sound biased but who is right here?

Papa Elon has never steered us wrong, but the might dick of the US Army hasnt either.

In my honest opinion, i feel that LiDar is in its infancy, and even if Papa Musk is right, LAZR can sell their tech to other industries like air travel/space/defense

171,An Unorthodox Nano-X Imaging (NNOX) DD,6,k67zj9,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k67zj9/an_unorthodox_nanox_imaging_nnox_dd/,21,"Hello retards, I am not a business-oriented person. I am a chemistry nerd and medical student. I don't know shit about the stock market and I hope ya'll can point out where I am wrong by doing your own DD. Here's my DD about NNOX technology and I hope you can see why I'm excited about it.  

**What is NNOX?**

Here's their company statement:  We have developed a digital X-ray source enabling a cost reduction of imaging systems by orders of magnitude. We are a global company planning mass deployment of imaging systems. Our goal is to drive ¬†early detection preventive healthcare as a new standard of care.

Basically, they made a cheaper and smaller X-ray device. They currently have a 2D model (simple X-ray) and a 3D model (CT scan) called the Nano-X ARC. That's their whole thing. It sounds boring as hell and their CEO Ran Poliakine has said on multiple occasions that their product is not groundbreaking: ""X-ray is X-ray"".

**Why is their technology special?**

It isn't. Traditional X-ray and CT machines use a hot spinning cathode that is large and requires active cooling or long off-cycles to not break. Cold cathode tubes are nothing special, and have been around for a long time. In fact, there are cold-cathode X-rays already on the market ([Meiden](https://www.meidensha.com/news/news_03/news_03_01/1231258_3190.html), [Carestream](https://www.cmxmedicalimaging.com/product/carestream-drx-revolution-nano-mobile-x-ray-system/) \+ [Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/d9t1w5/testing_a_carestream_nano_portable_xray_unit/)).  What they are doing is comparable to replacing incandescent light bulbs with LEDs.

https://preview.redd.it/yh58knp4o1361.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f23221a8cfa82b0378d45cefe433e89b05d3bc8

**Why is this exciting?**

Foxconn is why this is exciting. The cold cathode X-rays mentioned above use carbon nanotubes ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/437968a)). However, if you look at Nano-X images and promotional material, it seems to be almost like a semiconductor chip. They are making nanolithography-printed chips that can be cheaply mass-produced by Foxconn, who have invested in this technology ([Their engineer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11431-009-0156-7)). Nanolithography is basically printing on a very small scale, and I've been a major fanboy of this Northwestern scientist who pioneered it ([Mirkin](https://mirkin-group.northwestern.edu/project/dip-pen-nanolithograph/)). This is going to make these things cheap as hell (relatively).

**Monetization and business plan**

Their machines will initially be limited to whoever preordered them. They're selling them at a loss but charging per scan to make up the cost (estimated 1-3 years breakeven). Similar to game consoles nowadays. I don't have any idea what this means for their fundamentals but I can tell you the CT and X-ray machines at our hospital are constantly scanning and printing money for the hospital. Someone please tell me if this is a stupid business model so I can exit this position.

**NNOX started their IPO with a bang, then Citron and Muddy came in**

Their stock price was overbought on September 14th, and they were smeared as the next Theranos. Huge price drop. Keep in mind that their CEO has run a company into the ground, no academic papers were published, and no one has actually seen their machine work yet. The short sellers just pointed out the obvious. Then, NNOX announced they would showcase their device at the RSNA (Radiological Society of North America) where all the US radiologists visit (virtually) to bump shoulders and review academic research. Stock rose and dipped again in anticipation yesterday. The bar was so low. All NNOX needed to do was to show a working machine...

**AND THEY FUCKING DID IT (**[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcrzuODNhrs&t=14s)**)**

I got to see them do this shit live thanks to my professor! I bought the dip immediately (24 shares $88 avg) and it feels almost like insider trading. Basically, they showed a 2D scan and a 3D scan. The 2D scan was nothing special (XRAY is XRAY) but the CEO wanted to scan his own hand. However, the 3D scan was amazing. The 3D tomography was clearly noisy and crude, but the visualization is very high-res and crisp.

Some skeptics about the images say that their fake, but they look very real to me. The hand X-Ray matches his hand perfectly, and the 3D has peripheral noise as opposed to axial axial artifacts that a CT machine would produce. It looks like they may need some software engineers to tighten up image quality though. They also criticize him for not doing a live CT scan, which would take at least 15 minutes and would also give him an unhealthy dose of radiation. Another design flaw is that their ARC machine looks like it would not support fat people.

**Next moves**

They are filing an 501(K) FDA approval. I don't know much about their filing except that it's the ""we're releasing existing technology"" filing. These filings from what I know, are typically accepted. Some critics say they should be filing for a more exciting and risky FDA approval of some sort, but I think their tech is just old stuff used correctly. Hopefully their stock keeps rising as they approach approval next year. What are your thoughts especially on the business side of things?"

They‚Äôre trying to get 32billion valuation. I already know it‚Äôs gonna get pumped. My question is which of the 3 DoorDash, GrubHub, Uber do y‚Äôall think is the best?

Doordash valuation 23.8 - 27 billion approx. outstanding shares 317.7 million after ipo approx. raising about 2.8 billion about $75 - $85 last round raised in late June at 16 billion valuation. Had 1.9 billion in revenue in last 9 month about 543 million customers and adj. ebitda -149 million

Q1 revenue 362 million adj. ebitda -129 million

Q2 revenue 675 million adj. ebitda 23 million

Q3 revenue 879 million adj. ebitda -43 million


Uber eat while is a part of Uber and ubers ride sharing has taken a hit you can say Uber eats approx. valuation is 37.3 - 56 billion (40% - 60% Uber value) outstanding shares 1.76 billion.
About 3.1 billion revenue unknown number of customers (remember seeing somewhere they had over 500mil customer too) adj. ebitda -728 million in 9 months

Q1 revenue 819 million adj. ebitda -313 million (Uber eats only)

Q2 revenue 1.211 billion adj. ebitda -232 million (Uber eats only)

Q3 revenue 1.451 billion adj. ebitda -183 million (Uber eats only)

GrubHub valuation 6.46 billion and shares outstanding 92.75 million and revenue last 9 months 1.316 billion and adj ebitda of 78 million

Q1 revenue 363 million adj. ebitda 21 million

Q2 revenue 459 million adj. ebitda 13.3 million

Q3 revenue 494 million adj. ebitda 43.7 million

supposedly doordash has 50% of market shares but I don‚Äôt believe that based off the numbers and number of locations. Uber had higher GOV and slightly higher revenues and both Uber and doordash had about 500 million customers still Uber reported slightly more. I believe Uber and doordash to be almost equal in market share Uber 37% doordash 35% GrubHub 23% other 5%. Now the question is GrubHub crazy undervalued if doordash and Uber eats both worth over 25 billion? Grubhub would be easier to pump lower float. But doordash is gonna have ipo hype

TLDR: Which of the 3 food delivery is the best to invest in Doordash, Uber (Uber Eats), GrubHub?

For the last few months, I have watched this sub decay into exclusively meme stocks, SPACS, EV, GYNA companies, Weed stocks, and a government backed Skynet. Instead of presenting real buying opportunities, WSB has been filled with pump and dumps and shit stocks. This is not that, this is a real market opportunity to make gains by BUYING THE FUCKING DIP. This DXCM dip has been completely overlooked by WSBets...because once again, you're all fucking degenerate autists. I know this because I am too, I participated in many of the swings and after breaking my neck a couple times, the whiplash caused me to do my own research and fall back on the most basic principle BUY THE FUCKING DIP.

I believe so strongly in this position that I have YOLO'd $80k into DXCM calls. You can see my positions and my ass at the bottom of this post.

Now my analysis of DXCM is broken down into 7 parts: The Product and Increasing Market Share, \~FuNdAmEnTaLs\~, price targets, Revenue, Earnings, Partnerships, Competition, COVID impacts, and most importantly THE DIP. This post is pretty long, but the TL;DR is that this company is recovering quickly from a massive dip, dominates the market, and presents a great tendies taking opportunity.

**The Product and Increasing Market Share**

DEXCOM is undoubtedly the best diabetes management device in the market and their market shares continue to grow as more Type 1 diabetics are switching from syringes and finger pricks to insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors.

Dexcom is currently the market leader in continuous glucose monitors. If you don't know what a continuous glucose monitor is, simply put, Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) tracks glucose levels throughout the day and night and can alert Type 1 Diabetics if their levels go too high or low. CGM systems take glucose measurements at regular 5 minute intervals, 24/7, and translate them into dynamic data to show glucose direction and rate of change. Dexcom CGM tracks glucose levels continuously throughout the day and night, while simultaneously sending glucose readings to the user's smart device or receiver every five minutes. Dexcom CGM then translates readings into dynamic data so that Type 1 diabetics are better able to manage treatment.

**\~FuNdAmEnTaLs\~**

**Price Targets and Strong Buy Recommendation** \- Avg Price Target of **$445.60**, Currently trades at $334

DXCM is currently trading more than $100 under its price target and is closing the gap rapidly as it recovers from its recent November dip. See the Analyst Consensus Rating below:

[AVG. PRICE TARGET $445.60](https://preview.redd.it/jceur9o6su261.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b2c196f05dfd7bdf3444e42aa3066d4ac15e4b1)

DXCM is currently rated as a Strong Buy by almost all analysts.

[DXCM = Strong Buy ](https://preview.redd.it/g6x9gc0e8v261.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e967ca9c66ade9770a0419e6ab244a4c2114490)

**Steady Revenue Growth, Balance Sheet, and Growing Market Share -** Dexcom Revenue continues to steadily climb and just passed half a billion last quarter with positive cash flow on its balance sheet, a growing market share, and an increase in Continuous Glucose Monitor users worldwide.

[Continued Revenue Growth ](https://preview.redd.it/g031y7q60v261.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f86e4f844f99fb49e1d4d8ac09ece7ace2acdd)

**Earnings -** Dexcom does not miss on earnings and has consistently beaten expectations by wide margins. I expect they will continue to do so next year as more diabetics get back to regular endocrinologist appointments. See the graph below:

[DEXCOM ALWAYS BEATS EARNINGS](https://preview.redd.it/u6vuq1vfzu261.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e50be2755bc34b313d7dd6fafa0e2f480997fc9)

**Key Partnerships -** From Wikipedia - ""[Tandem Diabetes Care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_Diabetes_Care) received FDA approval in December 2019 for Control-IQ, a closed-loop technology that uses Tandem's t:slim X2 insulin pump and the Dexcom G6 to ""to automatically increase, decrease, or stop the delivery of insulin in response to the glucose levels of people with Type 1 diabetes."" Dexcom entered into a partnership with Livongo, a digital chronic care management company, in January 2020 to share CGM data from the Dexcom G6 with Livongo‚Äôs platform. This integration will allow Livongo to incorporate the CGM data along with other patient data to provide health insights based on its algorithm to help patients manage their diabetes. In February 2020, Dexcom and Insulet Corporation signed a non-exclusive, global agreement to combine current and future Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring systems with Insulet‚Äôs tubeless insulin delivery Pod into the Omnipod Horizon‚Ñ¢ System for automated insulin delivery. This will give the ability to adjust insulin doses based on Insulet‚Äôs algorithm or through their smartphone. The company also announced in March 2020 a partnership with Welldoc to integrate G6 CGM data with BlueStar, a digital platform for diabetes management. BlueStar will combine the CGM data with information on patients' activity, nutrition, sleep and other factors to help them manage their condition."" [\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexcom#cite_note-25)

**Little Competition and Positive Market Sentiment**

There are 3 major players in the Continuous Glucose Monitor market. They are Dexcom, Guardian Medtronic, and Freestyle Libre. Dexcom is by far the most advanced, accurate and used device of these three. I will try to highlight the main advantages of the Dexcom over the competition, but I highly recommend you look into the reviews and research around the accuracy and features of these devices. The points below are from SugarMDs - [https://sugarmds.com/dexcom-g6-versus-freestyle-libre-cgm/#:\~:text=CGM(%20Dexcom%20or%20libre)%20is,an%20insulin%20pump%20or%20independently](https://sugarmds.com/dexcom-g6-versus-freestyle-libre-cgm/#:~:text=CGM(%20Dexcom%20or%20libre)%20is,an%20insulin%20pump%20or%20independently)

1. Dexcom has nightime monitoring for increased safety - ""One of the biggest risks that a person faces is highs and lows while they are sleeping. A Dexcom G6 and Guardian Medtronic (but not Libre) CGM system can monitor and alert you at night should your blood glucose drops. Unfortunately freestyle libre does not have that feature.¬† You can also choose to notify someone about your blood sugar levels by sharing your glucose data. The timely warning can prevent you from experiencing side effects related to highs and lows.
2. Accuracy - ""Between the Dexcom versus libre, Dexcom appears to be more accurate in the low glucose ranges below 80 mg/dL compared to libre.""
3. No finger pricks - The dexcom, unlike Guardian Medtronic which needs to be calibrated at least once every 12 hours, does not require any finger pricks to calibrate the device. This saves patients hundreds of dollars on test strips and is one of the best features of the device behind it's accuracy.
4. Customer Service, Reputation, and Retention - Top of the line customer service that is dedicated to serving patients. ""If a sensor stops working or doesn‚Äôt insert correctly, tech support is easy to get a hold of. After a few questions, they will replace a sensor that does not work. They might even send two."" [https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre](https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre)

&#x200B;

**COVID Impacts**

1. COVID created increased awareness of the importance of monitoring underlying conditions. I believe this will be a huge driving force behind growing revenues and market shares for Dexcom. Diabetics are now, more than ever, acutely aware of the need to monitor their Diabetes closely and Dexcom is the best product for that.
2. Increased Dexcom orders as patients return to quarterly endocrinologist appointments. Although, Dexcom beats earnings every quarter, I believe they will have even larger beats in 2021 as more patients transition back to seeing their care providers in person and will be able to see the products for themselves in medical offices.

**Buy the Dip - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT**

In November, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen slashed his 12-month price target on the stock from $420 to $350. Biegelsen cited increased competition and pricing pressure in the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) space following the approval of Abbott Labs' Freestyle Libre 3 CGM in Europe. Abbott's CGM system is reportedly priced at $1,066 per year, whereas DexCom's G6 device runs about $2,496 per year.

This slashed price target was unjustified and the Analyst Consensus Rating above confirms that with an average price target of $445.60. It was unjustified for two specific reasons.

First, there is major consensus and sentiment among diabetics that Dexcom is the most accurate continuous glucose monitor on the market justifying its higher cost (See here - [https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre](https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre) or look at r/diabetes_t1 to get a feel for the love that surrounds the Dexcom and the impact that it has on the lives of Type 1 diabetics).

Second, the pricing differential did not justify such a drastic price slash. This is because for an ever growing number of patients insurance covers the cost of these continuous glucose monitors so price isn't a factor as diabetics always hit their deductibles due to insulin costs. Additionally, people do not skimp on price or often choose the cheaper device when it comes to their health. The reliability and accuracy of the Dexcom justifies its higher price. It's the best on the market and diabetics know it.

Anyway, as you can see from the graph. The stock has dipped from $420 to around $320 in the past month, but is quickly picking up momentum back towards the average analyst price target of $445.60. Moreover, pre-COVID the stock was trading at $456.23 and will likely blow past its ATH over the next year.

[Dip to $320 in Nov. Currently Rebounding back to $400+](https://preview.redd.it/8gla7g5dpu261.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4d0c429c14096253284c6b447f67e012f4fac4b)

**The Play**

I think this stock will run and run fast over the next couple months in anticipation of February earnings and as institutions dump their money back into a stable medical company. I would recommend playing stocks or long term ATM or ORM LEAP calls as DXCM has low options liquidity atm. The idea is to profit from the November dip that I touched on above. I am in for $80k total. I am all in and believe in this position, I would not be posting if I didn't think this was a sure thing. These are the trades:

**1) $5k in DXCM $340c 1/15**

**2) $45k in DXCM $340c 3/19  (All in on my $20k Roth IRA and $25k in my main)**

**3) $30k in DXCM $350c 6/18**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Buy 2021 Leaps on DXCM, they are the best products on the market and currently heavily undervalued and recovering rapidly from a major dip.

**\*Personal Note and Kiss My Ass\***

On a personal note, I myself am a Type 1 Diabetic that uses the Dexcom CGM. I transitioned earlier this year from the Guardian Medtronic CGM and the device has been life changing. It has lowered my A1C levels, made my diabetes incredibly more manageable, and conveniently links with my iPhone and Apple watch which has made it a very enjoyable device to use. I've also attached a photo of my device so you can also get a feel for what the Dexcom CGM looks like and so that you autist fucks can kiss my ass when this play makes you tendies.

It happened with all 3 big index ETFS, QQQ, SPY, and DIA. In Spy's case the crash caused it to be red for the day (sorry for those who got smacked by that one lol. Especially option traders)

The only recent news I can see that may cause concern was one of the vaccine manufacturers  had cut down the amount of vaccines it could produce but that was earlier and priced in, and superseded by the ""implication"" that a new stimulus was ""close"" to being negotiated in Congress.

I don't see any other recent MAJOR news that would cause that kind of drop."

 For me it's a hold/wait. I missed the wave and most people did but it's apples and oranges can't compare the too.

But basically Opendoor is 10x better at ibuying compared to Zillow but Zillow has the strongest MOAT at the moment and make Majority of their revenue from Buyer Agents(ME).

1. A company which sees consecutive days of +20% then pulls back for a few days is not dead lol
2. Don't give WSB financial advice to anyone, especially not you're mom lol
3. Just because you lucked out 600% on an option, once, does not make you experienced
4. Don't quit your job to become a day trader, you will get fucked over multiple time, sans lube
5. You can't access bb terminal without a license, and before you ask, you wont afford one
6. Don't play the options casino if you can't afford to get crushed

Let‚Äôs talk about what happened yesterday in the stock market**

Hey everyone! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw both the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/sKKNVjr) and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/PzxfrWt) up about 0,2% with the SP closing at a new record high while the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/f909849) trailed and finished just below the previous close, down only 0,05%. We did see a spike in the [VIX](https://ibb.co/QMqhtMv) of almost 2% as this was quite a volatile day with the market dropping at the open before regaining traction in the middle of the trading day. We saw a relatively even market yesterday as 56% of companies were advancing on below average volume as most of the companies continue to trade well above the moving averages. The leading [sectors](https://ibb.co/d0740g8) yesterday were Energy and Financials with Materials and Real Estate lagging the market as [Small and Large Cap value plays](https://ibb.co/hLDgLmm) kept the market positive with companies like Boeing being up [more than 5%](https://ibb.co/b3jRN2s) for the day after good news on multiple fronts like Ryanair [probably](https://ibb.co/8xpKXxQ) acquiring new planes and the [first flights made](https://ibb.co/qmJNkPc) with the new 737 by American.

[STOCK MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/BPVFx2d)

Here is a complete [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TKsdbDn) from yesterday as we saw an even market as I said earlier, with Salesforce being the only big looser in big caps as the stock continued to dive after the Slack news. I think this was a great opportunity to buy the stock in a dip as I doubled my portfolio value on the company from 1,5% to 3% of my portfolio while also getting in [more](https://ibb.co/Pr47Th5) on Boeing, Apple, Netflix and a couple of other companies.

We also got the AAII investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/KxkbTbb) yesterday as the percentage of bulls has increased constantly in the last month. This is usually a very bad sign for the stock market as corrections, consolidations or even crashes occur when people tend be over-bullish. I don‚Äôt think this will be the case at least for a couple of weeks, though I think we are poised for a small market correction in the near future before moving on even higher.

Here is the most interesting [economic data](https://ibb.co/PD2XBsn) that will be released today as we get new jobless claims as well as services PMI and ISM. I expect the jobless claims to continue to get worse sadly for the next couple of weeks at least until the vaccine starts to get distributed with ADP November jobs [numbers](https://ibb.co/S6V64xJ) coming in yesterday shy of forecasts and at the lowest level since July, this is not great news for the jobless claims that will pop up early today. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/wQ3mK2b)

\[Later EDIT\] - Jobless claims came in way better than expected : [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/Jscz1SZ)

Great news came in this morning as the US is [expected](https://ibb.co/vYp0LDT) to have capability to immunize at least 100 million people by the end of February, that is great news, as specialist believe a herd immunity can be reached if there are about 60-80% of people either immunized or have already developed natural antibodies.

We also have a couple of interesting earnings [scheduled](https://ibb.co/6nJjrRY) for Today, as I expect Kroger to beat the estimates, though I didn‚Äôt get any action on this, I did get some [action](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) on [Marvell](https://ibb.co/34x6mpN) as I bought the stock about a week ago. While I expected Dollar General to do alright and I think we might see some disappointment in [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/BPsz5Mj) just like I thought we would see bad reaction to great earnings with Zoom.

\[Later Edit:

\-Dollar General [reported](https://ibb.co/gJPRpXM) a beat on top & bottom line but did not offer guidance and the shares of the company have pulled back in pre-market trading 1,6%

\-Kroger [beats EPS](https://ibb.co/bgsMckw) by 0,05$ but misses on revenue by $310M, shares down 4% pre-market\]

Alongside Marvell which I expect to beat the estimates of 25cents per share and also beat on revenue, I also [bought](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) Okta which released earnings yesterday and [crushed](https://ibb.co/VmvBzYV) expectations as recurring [subscription revenue](https://ibb.co/nftnckz) grew by more than 40% year over year as well as big increases in operating margins, billings and customers. This led the stock to [spike 8%](https://ibb.co/xzyy0qr) after hours as I will make a good profit on the investment and may even consider holding this position for the long term in the company.

Also, one other staple company from my [portfolio](https://ibb.co/pKbNy8M), CrowdStrike released earnings yesterday and delivered great [results](https://ibb.co/dgyfn8g) as the annual recurring [revenue](https://ibb.co/N6vhWfW) has grown more than 80% year over year while adding over 11hundred new subscriptions this quarter while also improving [gross margins](https://ibb.co/THfGJ2c) by 2%. The company also gave guidance for next quarter way over analyst expectations as that made the [stock soar 13%](https://ibb.co/ZGxbsRx)

The only big disappointment from earnings released yesterday was [SNOWFLAKE](https://ibb.co/6BhYKHC) as they have suffered the same way as Palantir in the first earnings report as analysts were expecting even bigger numbers after the huge rally the stock has had since the IPO. One Morgan Stanley analyst said that they needed to deliver around a 140% growth of revenue to make a good impact on the stock as the company‚Äôs revenue only grew up 102%. If it continues to drop it might find the way to a good entry point, but for the moment I believe this price is to high for the company.

We also got news yesterday as the House [passed](https://ibb.co/w0Ly1MP) the billt hat allows Chinese companies to be delisted if they do not comply with new auditing rules, as this measure is expected to by signed fast by Trump.

I think this is good news for investors in the long-run as I don‚Äôt believe big companies like Alibaba will suffer from this, with BABA being audited by established PWC Hong Kong auditors, though this might be a bigger problem for smaller companies that are not able to follow the rules. I still believe Alibaba is a great company to buy at this price point as the company has [dropped](https://ibb.co/W283kbG) due to bad news developments in the last 2 months, but I think has a lot of room to go higher, even testing the previous highs of 319$ and surpassing them, especially with this holiday season having great sales numbers.

This news combined with the recent [upgrade](https://ibb.co/c2mwgPc) at Goldman was music to the ears of Tesla investors as the stock rose almost 3% after hours and erased the daily losses.

Other news came as the House is expected to vote on the [MORE ACT](https://ibb.co/RgjnPgY), though this will be surely blocked in the Senate, this is still good news for the cannabis sector as states will likely legalize this way before we can a national bill.

While Palantir dropped big yesterday after Morgan Stanley [warned](https://ibb.co/m4NsSWr) for a negative-risk reward in the stock as the stock has dropped more than 20% in the last 5 trading days, I sold out of my position on Palantir for a 40% profit recently but I may get back in if the price starts to make more sense.

So, with the latest developments, I believe investors should not forget about the FAANG stocks that have brought us back from the depths of the March lows. [FACEBOOK](https://ibb.co/gFd1S5R) still gives small business that will be back when the economy returns the best bang for the buck in advertising, especially with the great platform that Instagram has become.

While [APPLE](https://ibb.co/j4YW4Qy) seems to be doing very well with the iPhone 12 sales and the new 5G cycle while also growing the services business very fast, that will bring them more and more steady cash flows for the company.

Despite missing the latest sub numbers, [NETFLIX](https://ibb.co/LJ8fr37), is still producing a lot of great content, has the most subs and the most content available for streaming and I believe they will remain the best in business alongside with Disney+

What can you say about [AMAZON](https://ibb.co/nrD5qnY) as they are a death star for every sector they get in‚Ä¶ E-commerce is here to stay, and Amazon still has huge room for growth especially in Europe and Asia.

While [GOOGLE](https://ibb.co/tz2htpn) was the laggard for most of the year, with travel & entertainment returning to advertising, this will be very good for the company, as travel is the biggest advertiser usually.

This companies will remain great owns for the long run, even if they underperform now, which I don‚Äôt expect, in the long-run this will remain some of the biggest winners in this new economy.

And don‚Äôt forget December is usually a great month for stocks as people tend to not take profits on capital gains at the end of the year, so it is likely that people will keep the winners while also receiving a boost from the stock market Santa Claus effect.

1. SOR: You need to understand that for every position there is a buyer and a seller.If you are trading short term, you want to be going against liquidity(news).
2. *Warren Buffett* quote:  ‚ÄúThe *stock market* is a *device* for *transferring money* from the *impatient* to the *patient*.If you are trading long term, you need to be patient and have enough bankroll to cover your positions.
3. Support and Resistance

I bought 1,000 shares of NTZ for $2.52/share.  I think it ended that day under $2.  It ends up tanking down to the low 1s and staying there for a while.  

I forget all about it, then one day notice that my losses have been erased and it has started to turn a profit.  When I bought it, I thought it was another Covid stock, but turns out to be an Italian furniture company.  

It slowly starts making me a few hundred dollars a day, then all of a sudden it goes up to 4, 5, and a week later up to 7.  At this point I should sell but don‚Äôt.  Then it goes under 5 and a week or two later, back in the 7s, where it started this week.  Of course NOW I definitely should sell, but still I don‚Äôt.  Yesterday it jumps to 9 and today 11.   Surely it can‚Äôt keep going up?  Right?  Am I crazy not to sell tomorrow morning? 


TLDR:  So I am now up almost $9,000 profit from a $2,500 investment on a stock I bought by mistake!  Do I try to squeeze more out of this, or am I absolutely retarded if I don‚Äôt take my gains and run!

UPDATE:  
Thanks for all the great advice and great shit talking!  So I decided to set a trailing stop quote at 8%.  Which I believe means that I get to continue enjoying gains until it slips to 8% of the most recent high, where it will automatically trigger a sale at that price.  If anyone can confirm this, that would be great!  

And wouldn‚Äôt you know it, the stock is still going up and in the 12s today.  I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but I think I‚Äôm locked to sell at no less than 11.22 which would be $8,700 profit!"

From the FT

Quick quiz: What do Virgin Galactic and Plug Power have in common?

On the face of it they are totally unrelated companies. The former offers day-trips to space for the unspeakably wealthy, the latter hydrogen fuel systems for equipment and electric cars. But both soared double digits Wednesday on seemingly no news:

What they share is that both have become the object of co-ordinated buying by users on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets. If you‚Äôre not familiar with this particular corner of the world‚Äôs most popular messageboard, it‚Äôs where retail punters go to discuss their punts, and much more besides. ‚ÄúLike 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal,‚Äù as the website accurately describes itself.

Scroll through it today and you‚Äôll find dozens of posts boasting of giant gains on call options and straight equity purchases with Virgin Galactic and Plug Power, along with punter-favourites Tesla, Nvidia and AMD.

Normally retail investor activity is but a drop in the ocean in the $30tn US equity market. Not this time. The behaviour is so pronounced that options trading has been showing up in aggregate market data, as Jennifer Ablan reported Wednesday:

While the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq have surged to record highs in recent weeks, another rally has taken hold. The US options market has been experiencing a huge jump in trading ‚Äî led by large-capitalisation companies including Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Disney, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Vishal Vivek, equity derivatives strategist at the New York-based bank, noted that trading volumes in US options were now almost as high as volumes on the underlying stocks, at 91 per cent. That is the highest level in at least the past 14 years, and about three times the equivalent percentage in 2016.

These co-ordinated attempts to take a stock ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù does call into question whether it constitutes market manipulation.

After all, nearly every time a company‚Äôs share price collapses hurt executives, shareholders and government point the finger at a ‚Äúbear attack‚Äù by evil short-sellers. Often taking legal or market measures to try and shut down the selling. But what about when a price shoots higher? Silence so far.

Question is: will the exchanges and regulators feel the need to do anything about it?

Oversight of US equities trading is a strange beast. Technically it is run by the Securities and Exchange Commission but fully-regulated exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and CBOE Global Markets have a quasi-governmental status too.

All parties are governed by the Exchange Act of 1934, and on the first page one value seems eternal:

...there is an important national interest in maintaining fair and orderly securities trading, assuring the fairness of securities transactions and markets and protecting investors.

That stipulation is in part to ensure trades are done in an economically efficient way and that there‚Äôs fair competition between all. But it‚Äôs also to ensure: ‚Äúthe availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities.‚Äù

You could argue that a bunch of people publicly discussing their plans on a free website qualifies on that score.

However, on the ‚Äúfair and orderly‚Äù stipulation, the Reddit bull attacks arguably fail the test. There isn‚Äôt anything orderly about a stock exploding just because a bunch of retail investors decide they want it to.

To what degree the swing to commission free trading in the US has helped to fuel this collective behaviour is another thing worth bearing in mind.

In that context, what can regulators do? One thing they might want to look at is who exactly is posting on these websites.

During the dotcom boom, Yahoo message-boards and AOL chat rooms were the Reddit-equivalent. But, as we found out after the fact, not everyone was an impartial observer.

Take the story of John Freeman, who in the late ‚Äò90s worked as a temp at banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. There, he became aware of mergers and acquisitions long before they happened, which he shared with his pals online. The game was up, according to Dan Davies‚Äô book Lying for Money, when the SEC realised a giant flow of prescient market orders for a takeover target were coming through one stockbroker in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

FT Alphaville is not suggesting the same thing is happening here ‚Äî after all, these bets are placed purely, it seems, ‚Äúfor the lols‚Äù. But then again, what‚Äôs to stop one company insider, desperate for whatever reason to make their stock rise, faking a screenshot of a giant call option trade on the site in the hope the herd follows? Not much, we suggest.

On the face of it Reddit users don‚Äôt appear to be aware of what they‚Äôre doing. Here‚Äôs one quote from a user looking to pump Microsoft‚Äôs stock:

Also if this happens to be illegal, I don't know about it so I'm safe.

This is the internet, so who really knows anything. If the quote is genuine, FT Alphaville isn‚Äôt sure the rationale will hold a lot of water if and when officials come knocking."

1. Pick a SOLO theme and stick to your conviction.  
2. Buy calls months out.  
3. Split your buying up into bunches. If you wanted to buy $50k of something, buy $10k to start and buy $5k on every solid bounce in either direction (dip or boost) you see.  
4. Roll calls out a month ahead if shit isn't going your way yet.    
5. Have a target and be willing to pull out once you hit it or at least significantly scale back.   
6. Don't be afraid to walk away if shit clearly isn't working. How idiots stuck by NKLA after the truck rolling video is a good example here. Sure it worked for a little while longer, but the greed got crushed recently.  
  
  
Don't do weeklies unless you don't like your money. Don't follow random advice, it works sometimes it doesn't other times. Stick to your plan. Using OptionsProfitCalculator and other tools to see if it's even worth the risk is a good place to start. Asking yourself questions like is this even possible for this to do what I'm hoping it does - is a good place to start.      
    
TL;DR - Have a plan, stick to it, adapt as shit happens."

This video pretty much outlines why it's a safe bet and a sound investment.

but that's not why I'm here. This has been a long time coming.

Let me start by saying that I got into ""investing"" years ago with a couple hundred bucks just fucking around on E\*TRADE spending $7 to buy $25 worth of stock only to find out it was $7 to sell it. Later on, I found out about an app called Robinhood that was made for window licking retards like myself. It was glorious, I could day trade up to 3x in one day before I lost everything and got locked out of my account for a week. I enjoyed it greatly.

Then on December 23rd 2019 I saw an article on Marketwatch about how Draftkings was going public thru a SPAC. I didn't know what the fuck a SPAC was but it was just days before Christmas so I had a couple days off to research it. I took the couple hundred bucks in my account and I bought all the $DEAC I could get my hands on. Since then I have found this sub with other degenerate gamblers and retards like myself. Between the success of $DEAC / $DKNG, $PLTR, and $TQQQ (and others I can not mention) I managed to turn that 2K into over $80,000

I have been following the $PSTH saga thru infamousbreadfruit AKA Yolocapitalinc on twitter, since early October...

The Jackie Reses situation is just too coincidental. She previously she spent seven years handling mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs, the works at the Head of Square Capital for 5 years, then joins the board of $PSTH, then goes on Twitter and ""liked"" a picture of the Stripe logo... v sus if you ask me...

The recent influx of videos to hit twitter have the story

I don't come on here much to be honest but there's also some good DD that has been posted in the past that is easily accessible. Anyways I know I am going on and on but the point is I am going all fucking in.

I recently refinanced on my house to get a great rate and decided to take some cash out to ""invest""...

I'm taking the 80K profit this year from that other shit, throwing the cash out from the mortgage (20K) into half option calls, half shares on $PSTH. Yolo is relative. I basically live paycheck to paycheck and this is well over a year's salary.

Why? Because of all of the PLTR bag holders. Yeah, some of you bought horrendously OTM short-term calls, sure, but some of you were people looking at 400% gains and you held because PLTR to the moon.

I keep seeing a lot of advice posts in here that are all great even if none of you retards are actually following that advice, but one more big piece here. I keep seeing people arguing with intense (and unearned) confidence that stock X will keep going up even though it's already gone up 559% in 6 months, stock Y (usually Tesla lol) kept going up when it was up 690% (see what I did there). But guess what fuckers, these are two different cases.

I know we're all autistic in this sub but people need to have exit strategies. You have to recognize that you've already landed on the moon. When you're sitting on a 400% gain on a very risky run-up, it's extremely unrealistic for there to be no sort of pullback *even if the long-term thesis is still intact*. People are out here playing the lottery but you already fucking hit the lottery if you hit on 400%. Guys, the average return on stocks is roughly 8% historically (when you account for inflation). 400% is like 50x that. Yeah it's cool to post 10,000% gains and shit but you know what else is cool? Walking away with a big gain and not having to be the bottom bitch to the homeless guy who you share the dumpster behind wendy's with.

Loss porns were funny but I keep seeing ""lost my life savings"" or ""gambled on significant margin"" or ""i used student loan payments for this"" and it's really bumming me out. So either start using what little brain cells you have or at least leave out the context because I want to laugh at you without feeling bad.

CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) has been on fire as the world has been on fire due to COVID-19. This company has been doing so well this past month or so. The KEY thing here is that there are only 7...I repeat 7, Antigen tests for COVID-19 worldwide. Not in the US...worldwide. And CEMI has submitted their approval for a rapid antigen test waiting to be approved by the FDA for EUA.

Highlights of what you have missed since my last post:

* 12/2/2020: Chembio Diagnostics Awarded $12.7 Million by BARDA for Development of Rapid DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel and 510(k) Submission of the Rapid DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System
* 11/13/2020: Chembio received regulatory approval from Ag√™ncia Nacional de Vigil√¢ncia Sanit√°ria (ANVISA) to market the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System in Brazil.
* Craig Hallum upgraded CEMI as a buy today for $10 PT

That BARDA contract that they won will enable them to create a new test that looks at both Influenza A/B and COVID-19 with their DPP test.

On top of that, they have their 2 tests submitted with the FDA for EUA, the antigen and antibody test. The second those are approved, which is imminent, this thing will skyrocket.

Still long those original shares I posted at the bottom, but added 2000 additional shares on one account and 2500 on another account.

**----Previous Post on 10/16----**

Listen up here you degenerates...its time to do some due diligence on CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) and make some sweet tendies with it. Chembio is a leading point-of-care diagnostics company focused on detecting and diagnosing infectious diseases who have recently also gotten into creating tests for COVID-19. Here is why I think they are going to skyrocket:

* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System - Rapid Test Provides Results in Only 20 Minutes (Submitted Oct 15, 2020) ---- BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) has given Chembio their support throughout the development of the antigen system so there is is skin in the game here.
* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for New DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Test System - New Antibody Test System Provides Results in 15 Minutes from Finger Stick, Venous Whole Blood, Plasma, or Serum Samples (Submitted Sep 8, 2020)
* Chembio just received FDA Approval for DPP HIV-Syphilis System on October 2, 2020. The system includes the DPP HIV-Syphilis assay, a multiplex single-use test, and the DPP Micro Reader optical analyzer, and is being offered in¬†the United States¬†immediately.

Their platform, DPP, can flex into multiple different areas, and with a recent approval for their HIV-Syphilis test, as well as they are on the fast track for approval for their COVID-19 tests, this will be huge. Now what I will say is there share price went to \~$15 when they released their COVID-19 test, but it didnt show good results so the FDA removed their test from the market and caused the shares to tank. But thats ok, because the new CEO has his head on right and will get this done in the right way, especially with the funding from BARDA.

Any partnership, any approval from the FDA, and this will skyrocket. I am long on 6000 shares @ \~$4.62.

Good luck homies and as always, do your own due diligence to get those sweet tendies.

TL;DR: CEMI target share price of $15+"

**1.** It all started on 28 July when KODK got the $765M loan from the U.S. government and branch into pharmaceuticals (in addition to cameras and cryptocurency). I sent the news to dad. Because of 1) the fact that the loan was bigger than the market cap at the time and 2) some boomer nostalgia of long-lost Eastman Kodak greatness, dad immediately told us to ""BUY"" KODK.

**2.** So the next day, even while the stock went parabolic, I bought **1000 shares @ $28:**

For those who participated in this KODK pump, you remember the euphoria and gambling mania on 29 July. Stock was halted at least 5 times and each time it opened like $3-4 higher. I thought I (and dad) were pretty smart.

**3.** So of course I bought **450 more shares** (and at this point dad and sis also bought in), all the while with Mom warning us that ""stonks can't go up like this"":

https://preview.redd.it/swha6r056w261.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f7521512c244537d76e15563da3865d6fc3ba3

**4.** Then people started saying the loan wasn't quite right, and that there was some sketchy insider trading going on. Here was the position a few days later with my now $30 average:

**5.** And it kept tanking even more:

**6.** Eventually it reached the $6 levels ($5's, even). Like a prudent investor, I DCA my way through times of trouble, thinking to myself maybe KODK is gonna build its own electric truck soon. I bought **3,550 more shares to lower my average to $17's:**

**7.** With Donald Pump going out of office, I finally decided to sell. I don't have the exact screenshot from the app but according to my IBKR PortfolioAnalyst report I sold at **$7.11:**

That would put my loss at **$85,912.50 - $35,556.50 = $50,356.** Dad also liquidated at around this price but he had bought in cheaper so he didn't get too beaten up about it. Mom was really shaking her head at us with the ""I told you so's"" and that was the moment that I finally understood MOM KNOWS BEST.

===================================================================================

**BONUS MATERIAL**

**Bonus 1:** Here are some further losses on these things known as ""call options"" including where I skillfully turned $6,400 into $21:

TLDR: SPY 360 Puts 12/11  


I'm not going to lie, I tend to be a little bearish, but this looks like a great setup for a week long short. Over the last 3 trading sessions, SPY has hit the R1 resistance 3 times, but never breached it to close out the 6 hour candle. 6 hour RSI is at 66.5 (at the time of this post), which is almost at the 70 level after which it's considered overbought by all the algos.  


I believe that over the next week or so it should bounce of off the R1 and approach the pivot line (360ish level).  


This is not even considering all the stimulus talk starts and stops, which most likely won't get announced until the 11th (even if it does). So no immediate catalysts to the upside.

\`\`Upon analysis, it is clear that the Short Sellers Reports produced by the investment research companies were part of an orchestrated media attack aiming to promote short-sale-related capital gains by artificially lowering the share price of Nanox. As can be seen in the NASDAQ images below, this planned attack was successful. The share price of NNOX was favourably high prior to the release of the reports in the beginning of September 2020, and dropped significantly upon their release by Citron and Muddy Waters, and then again increased and stabilized in the end of November 2020. Furthermore, the fact that the Citron report has recently been moved into their archive provides some ancillary indication that this was, in fact, a planned short selling action \`\`

I've been disheartened by some of the comments I've read recently and just wanted to provide some tips for the genuine noobies/retards among us. If you already know this shit, congrats, move along sir.

Take a look at my previous, more advanced guide to some theta gang theory for those looking for something a bit more in depth: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how\_to\_consistently\_outperform\_the\_sp500\_using/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/)

Without further ado... TOP 5 TIPS Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.

# 1) You MUST understand Implied Volatility.

I made this the first point because it is the gigantic mistake I see noobies here making again and again. I'm talking to you, people who bought calls on PLTR at $30.  **If you learn anything from this post, you MUST learn this.**

You see a stock make a massive move either up or down. Your immediate response is ""this is a great opportunity to buy calls/puts on a volatile stock!"" Right? WRONG!

In fact, when a stock has just made a massive move in either direction, that is perhaps the WORST time to purchase options in EITHER direction. Options are not stupid. Options are designed to price in the fact that a stock is moving wildly. This is called ""implied volatility."" They become more expensive as a stock makes more dramatic moves, to price in the volatility you and everyone else is expecting.

It's quite possible and even likely that you buy an option on a high IV stock, and the stock moves in your direction, and yet you LOSE money, because it didn't move as dramatically as was expected by the implied volatility. **This is called ""IV crush.""** It only takes one or two experiences with IV crush for most traders to learn this lesson for life. If you understand this concept before you lose a ton of money, all the better.

**So, what should you do if a stock is highly volatile and options are expensive due to IV?**

There are two choices: Trade actual shares, or SELL the options rather than buy them.

If you are bullish on a high IV stock, you can take a bullish position by SELLING a cash-secured put rather than buying the call. If you are bearish on a high IV stock, you can take a bearish position by SELLING a call rather than buying a put (although this entails greater risk and will typically require higher options trading level by your broker).

# 2) You MUST have patience.

It's a tale as old as time. A noobie investor does some research, reads some DD, and is convinced a stock is going to rise over the next couple years. So he buys in. A bad day or two hits and the stock tanks. He panics, and sells. The next couple days the stock rises and appears to stabilize. So he buys back in again, because he still believes in his thesis. The stock drops again, and he panic sells again.

In reality the stock is just trading sideways, but this idiot keeps buying on green days and selling on red days. This is perhaps the most idiotic, suicidal strategy anyone could ever employ. Buying on green and selling on red is a surefire strategy to lose money consistently over time.

This is why you MUST remove your emotions from your trades, because your emotions will usually tell you to buy on green and sell on red, literally buy high and sell low. As the boomer Warren Buffett once stated: **""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""**

Here is a better approach. Set up your entire trade BEFORE you make the trade. Have a set price you will sell at if things go south. Have a target price you will sell at if things go well. Once the dust settles you can learn from any mistakes. Were you too aggressive, or too conservative in your targets? What emotions directed you to make those mistakes? Too much greed, too much risk aversion, too LITTLE risk aversion? Make every trade a learning opportunity.

# 3) You MUST understand ""Reversion to the Mean.""

In general, stocks will tend to revert to their trendlines.

This thesis is fairly simple. If a stock moons 10% in a day, the most likely event is a drop the next day. If a stock tanks 10% in a day, the most likely event is a rise the next day. This is because humans are emotional creatures. First, they overreact to big news. Next, one of two things happen: When the stock is way up, people see it as a profit taking opportunity, so they sell. When the stock is way down, people see it as a buying opportunity, so they buy.

I don't have any hard data to back up this thesis, but I'm sure there's a bunch of nerds out there with hard data that proves exactly this, as well as trading algorithms specifically designed for a ""reversion to the mean"" strategy that are consistently profitable.

Obviously there will be exceptions, as well as times when a big move signals a shift in the trendline. All I am saying is in the MAJORITY of cases, reversion to the mean will occur. Don't go chasing stocks that have made massive short-term swings in a single direction unless you have strong reasons (not just hopes) to believe the trend has changed.

# 4) You MUST not YOLO your account more than once (or twice).

This is going to be controversial for some of you. But it's just straight math. If you keep betting your entire account, or close to it, on single trades, **it's only a matter of time before you go broke. That is a mathematical guarantee.**

Let's say you are one of the most skilled, intelligent, informed investors on the planet (doubtful). So skilled your plays are 90% correct. If you bet your entire portfolio on each trade, you are still expected to go completely broke after around 10 trades.

Let's say you aren't a brilliant stonk gambler. Let's say you are just average and your trades are a coin flip (which is generous for a lot of you retards). **If you bet your entire bankroll on each bet, on average you will go completely broke in just 2 trades.**

Again, there is a lot of complicated math we can go through to predict account explosion times and optimal bet sizing and so on, but that isn't necessary here. Professional gamblers such as poker players have refined bankroll management theory, which usually means at the least they aren't putting more than 10% of their cash on the table in one sitting, usually closer to 5%. (Take a look at the ""Kelley criterion"" for an interesting read: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly\_criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion))

I know a lot of you are broke with no life prospects and hoping to get rich quick. I don't fault you for that, I get it. The problem arises when you see the people who got insanely lucky with guessing 10 coin flips in a row who turned $1000 into $1,000,000, and hope to do the same... **but for every one retard with a record like that you've got hundreds more who lose it all and have nothing to show for it.**

I won't fault anyone for making a gigantic, life-changing bet a single time. That is your choice to make, and it just might pay off. But if you think you are going to do that again and again and survive, you are delusional.

# 5) You MUST be Skeptical... of EVERYTHING.

Fools and their money are soon parted. Don't be a fool.

Your first instincts when hearing ANYTHING should be skepticism. Your friend has a hot stock tip? Start with skepticism. Some online DD on a meme or penny stock online sounds convincing? Start with skepticism. A highly respected financial or government agency gives future guidance on whatever... again, start with skepticism.

There are a million people out there trying to take advantage of you, to pump and dump you, to scam you, to trick you into spending more money on whatever.

There are times when being a conformist pays off, like when markets rally for months straight. There are times when being a contrarian pays off, like when markets tank and sectors collapse. Don't be a consistent conformist nor a consistent contrarian. Be skeptical of every thesis and every hypothesis you hear, or even the ones you invent yourself.

When you take this approach honestly and still become convinced of a thesis, you have a higher probability than most of being correct.

**Seek out opinions that contradict your biases, not opinions that confirm your biases.** This is incredibly difficult and goes against human nature, but if you can achieve this ideal, you will out-trade 90% of the public.

Its stores offer camping, fishing products, and hunting and shooting products. The earnings was announced yesterday and they were phenomenal. Their Q3 quarterly sales = 1/2 entire market Cap!

This one is undervalued by a lot!

The company made a gross profit of $334 million in last 3 quarters and trading at a market cap of $600 mn. It's insanely undervalued.Last 12 months revenue was more than that of SNOW ($1.2-$1.3 B) , yes, you heard it right.

1. TOMORROW: **Thursday December 3rd 2020 (11:30am EST)** \- Live demo of the Nano-X Arc at the Radiology Society of North America 2020 virtual conference. This demo is going to destroy Citron's fruity ass short claims (Reference all the companies that Citron shorted. Yeah... they're stupid.)
2. Can Happen at ANY moment - FDA 510(K) application in for a single-source device which could get approved ***before*** 1H 2021.
3. Mid-year 2021 - FDA 510(K) approval of the multi-source device, the one planned on being commercialized. This one is the bigger deal and is needed to drive revenue.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You might be thinking: ""Is this a 'sell the news' type event?""  
Answer: Yes and no.  
There are those that front-ran this stock's price action leading up to this event because they know how powerful of a catalyst this event can be. They will undoubtedly sell to secure profits AND to hedge themselves against the possibility that the demo fails (for whatever reason... HIGHLY DOUBTFUL btw).

But here's the kicker: if this event demo proves this company's technology - this will change the game of radiographic imaging as we know it.   
**In other words:** *Every* clinic and hospital in the *entire* world will want to get their hands on this revolutionary technology. And I'm not just talking about purely MD clinics. As a physical therapist myself, I'm talking about potentially utilizing this kind of imaging in our own outpatient clinics! (NO NEED for us to refer out to more expensive radiographic imaging clinics)  
The possibilities are endless.

The cup and handle pattern [has formed over the last 6 weeks](https://imgur.com/a/vHAWzv4) and is quite beautiful. However, if you‚Äôre playing this pattern you aren‚Äôt supposed to buy until it bounces back up and breaks the top of the cup.

Overall:

Walmart‚Äôs new online Walmart plus service is very enticing and costs little to run compared to Amazon. They could become the future Amazon if the amount of people with Walmart Plus continues to grow. They should make a lot of money online during the Christmas season and pandemic and you should expect very high earnings going forward.

Walmart is making a push into the pharmaceutical sector, investing money into the space. They also announced a healthcare/ health insurance 
program recently. Health is an area of huge potential due to the Pandemic causing focus on the health sector.

Walmart is the largest retail store but was not affected to badly by the pandemic. Since they are the largest retail store you can except the stock to rise after the current restrictions on retail stores are lifted without having to worry about it falling with bad pandemic news.

Walmart is:
- A new online retailer with huge potential 

- Growing in the healthcare and Pharmaceutical industries

-Set up to make money distributing COVID vaccines

- The largest physical retail company in the world. (Physical retail is a sector that goes up a lot with good pandemic news)

These types of stocks are all stocks that people look at to find huge potential in growth. Walmart is really innovating and putting themselves in a position to grow a lot as a company over the next few years. There‚Äôs a chance that they will become the world largest online retailer and worlds largest Pharmacy along with them being the worlds largest physical retail company. That might seem ridiculous but it is entirely possible. If you think this is bullshit I encourage you to read the three news articles below and my in depth analysis of the stock.





Thing to read (references and today‚Äôs news):

[Walmart Opening Pharmacies](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/walmart-to-open-health-superstores-what-it-means-for-real-estate-investors/)



My Findings:

1. Walmart is really pushing their new online store service Walmart Plus. Walmart Plus is like Amazon prime except Walmart Plus offers same day or next day shipping for free on any purchase and same day free grocery delivery. They are one of the only companies in the world that can do this because of their nationwide retail stores. Walmart retail stores near almost every town which allows for the faster delivery than Amazon. This faster delivery will entice people to join Walmart plus and gives them an advantage over Amazon. Faster delivery allows for them to ship perishable goods like groceries because they will stay fresh during the same day shipping. Walmart also can keep costs at a minimum for the service. Unlike Amazon they do not need to pay for huge warehouses and warehouse employees because they have many stores already established. Amazon also has to ship your products across the country first in a semi truck to a warehouse, then from the warehouse onto a separate delivery truck that goes to your house. Amazon has to pay Warehouse costs which include property taxes, upkeep, and the huge initial cost to open a warehouse. They also have to pay employees at the warehouses. They also have to pay for semi trucks, last mile delivery vans and the salaries of the employees driving them (or pay for a service like UPS).
Keep in mind Amazon has become one of the largest companies in the world. Walmart offers faster delivery while avoiding the fees for warehouses (they use their stores instead). They also have much lower costs on delivery. (They ship your products straight from your local Walmart to your house). If Amazon has become one of the top 5 companies in the world imagine the money Walmart will make by offering a similar service with faster deliveries with much less operating cost. With the bump in online sales during the Christmas season, and people turning to online shopping, Walmart can expect to gain a lot of new users on its new Walmart Plus service. They might buy tiktok too which shows their open to new and risky strategies and innovation. This makes Walmart a strong growth tech stock that could become the next Amazon.

2. Walmart is making big moves in the pharmaceutical space. They are opening more pharmacies and putting money into their pharmaceutical programs Walmart announced a new Health and Wellness EVP Dr. Cheryl Pegus, the former Chief medical officer of Walgreens. They should be able to make easy money with covid vaccine distribution and start making more in the pharmaceutical space overall. They are looking to take over CVS as the largest pharmacy In America. (They are currently the second largest) Walmart also started a healthcare program looking to capitalize on the health insurance market and take some of the market from companies like blue cross. They are looking to combine their new ventures into health with Walmart Plus and roll out a program to deliver perceptions to your home. There are rumors Walmart could even be able to deliver covid vaccines to homes once they are available. Take that with a grain of salt as it has not yet been confirmed by Walmart.


3. Walmart is the worlds largest retail chain. You would think that that they should have taken a huge hit with the pandemic like most other retail stores. They did not however and actually reported a 6% average grown in overall sales at retail stores. This is due to Walmart being an essential business because they sell groceries and other essential items. People still shopped at Walmart even with the pandemic going on which makes them a very stable stock. Just because they didn‚Äôt go down with covid does not mean they won‚Äôt go up when it goes away. I expect large gains in the stock once the pandemic is over. 



That took hours to write so I would appreciate it if you gave it an upvote and commented your thoughts :)

When Roblox was first brought to my attention, I thought they were some sort of gimmick legos. Full disclosure, I have never played this game, but I did play Runescape many, many years ago. Chopped the hell out of some Yew trees. This makes me not the least qualified to gauge Roblox as a video game, but we are gauging its potential as a stock instead.

   

* Roblox is a global platform where millions of people gather together to imagine, create, and share experiences with each other in immersive, user-generated 3D worlds
* Roblox plans to IPO before Christmas, so we take a look at the rumored valuation of $8bn
* Covid-19 has generated a huge boost to traffic with Daily Active Users ((DAUs)) growing 82%, hours engaged growing 122%, revenue growing 68%, bookings growing 171%, and a large $292.6 mm in free cash flow in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020
* The valuation story depends on Roblox's ability to continue growing once the Covid pandemic is in the rear-view mirror

**Roblox Business and Technology:** Roblox was founded in 2003 and has hit many milestones before the planned IPO launch. The most important recent developments being the Joint Venture with Tencent to establish Roblox China and re-launching Roblox Premium to develop a subscriber base with steadier cash flows.

&#x200B;

[Source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/v9zg6l79wr261.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=d09098392824ef50ccdb348012f121908456c473)

The Roblox business model is based on the underlying technology and infrastructure that support the 31.1 million average DAUs. Roblox defines a DAU as ""a user who has logged in and visited Roblox through our website or application on a unique registered account on a given calendar day. If a registered, logged in user visits Roblox more than once within a 24-hour period that spans two calendar days, that user is counted as a DAU only for the first calendar day"" [(source: company S-1)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm). 

This business is based on three elements:

* **Roblox Client:** The underlying app that allows users to explore 3D worlds
* **Roblox Studio:** The toolset that enables developers and creators to build, publish, and operate 3D      experiences and content 
* **Roblox Cloud:** The services and infrastructure that power the platform

[We think this is what Roblox players do, but we can't be sure](https://preview.redd.it/cw6x1j3dwr261.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=351745b196e484eca18f7a959dcc73cddb178c70)

The Roblox platform and the key technology characteristics are as follows:

* Identity: The Roblox avatar system allows users to create and personalize their unique 3D identities. There are a wide variety of character styles.
* Friends: The Roblox Client allows users to connect through various means, including detecting nearby players or meeting in the Roblox world. The social graph created by these connections is stored in the Roblox Cloud. The Roblox Platform supports text-based chat among users sharing the same 3D experience and between users connected through the social graph.
* Immersion: The Roblox platform allows developers to build deeply immersive 3D environments where users can share experiences.
* Low friction: Users have the ability to interact with experiences almost instantly, on most popular      client devices, and from anywhere in the world over existing broadband and cellular networks. When a user joins an online experience, the Roblox Cloud assigns that user to a particular game instance based on the user‚Äôs social graph, geographic location, spoken language, and age group. 
* Variety of content: Roblox provides developers with reference material, tutorials, community forums, and analytics to build their creations. **Developers and creators build nearly all of the content for the Roblox Platform.** Once content is built, it can be replicated and shared across multiple experiences giving developers the ability to scale their efforts and make rapid updates. There were over 18 million experiences on Roblox as of Sept 30, 2020.
* Global: The Roblox Platform serves a global audience. In the nine months ended September 30,      2020, developers from over 170 countries and users spanning over 180 countries accessed the platform.
* Economy: Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased.      Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content or by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer‚Äôs experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user‚Äôs monthly subscription fee. 

[Robux, the currency of the online Roblox world, buying options](https://preview.redd.it/ob8nmkdrwr261.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d00a16cb7c44c1d36329ef4692f1d85cd3b309)

**Developer Incentives:** With nearly the entire Roblox online universe being built by the ingenuity of developers and creators, Roblox has developed a system to incentivize natural development expansion.

Roblox currently offers developers and creators four ways to earn Robux:

* The sale of access to their experiences and enhancements to these experiences
* Engagement-based payouts - rewarding developers for the amount for time that Premium subscribers spend in their experiences
* The sale of content and tools between developers
* Sale of items to users through the Avatar marketplace

As users purchase and spend their Robux on Roblox, developers receive 70% of the Robux spent within their experiences and 70% of the items that appear in the Studio marketplace. Creators receive 30% of the Robux spent for their items on the Avatar marketplace.

[ Example of a store from Mining Simulator by Runaway Rumble within Roblox  ](https://preview.redd.it/ll886iywwr261.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=a297ebec391df538a2db9c580294c677a6b2d7c3)

These earned Robux are deposited into virtual accounts where developers can convert Robux into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of 1 Robux to $0.0035. In the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020, developers and creators earned $209.2 mm, up from $72.2 mm in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2019. Clearly, the Roblox developers and creators are also benefiting from the massive spike in users on Roblox.

**Current Roblox Business Profile:** When users sign up for Roblox, they can create an avatar and explore the vast majority of experiences for free, although the business model for any experience is ultimately up to the developer. Users can purchase Robux either as one-time purchases or via Roblox Premium, a subscription service billed monthly. 

For one-time purchases, users can purchase the virtual currency through various channels including the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, credit cards, prepaid cards, Microsoft app store, PayPal, and others. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 34% and 18% of Roblox revenue was generated on Apple App Store and Google Play Store, respectively. For operations through both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, Roblox must pay the customary 30% to Apple or Google. 

Roblox has managed to rapidly expand its DAU base. 

&#x200B;

[source: Company and our estimates](https://preview.redd.it/tgm7pzjzwr261.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=87bea9ab82d310c938dc0fff317a4ecbbb37ba47)

Roblox has grown its DAU count by 94.9% and 96.9% in Q2 and Q3 of this year, respectively. DAUs are up in every geographic region with the Rest of the World segment growth being particularly impressive. However, Roblox acknowledges that this upsurge in growth during the pandemic may not be sustainable when they say, ""We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline, and we may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods where we are comparing against COVID-19 impacted periods"" (source: company S-1).

The growth profile and future look of Roblox as an attractive investment hinges on their ability to keep the surge in DAU growth they've experienced as a result of the pandemic and then continue to grow their DAUs (albeit at a slower pace compared to 2020).

The DAU metrics show that 55.6% of DAUs in the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020 are under the age of 13. 

[source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/cyhv0lh2xr261.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=45a85667c88551495acbff9c346b7ea71da5cbdd)

DAUs drive spending, and Roblox has seen the average bookings per DAU increase as well. Bookings are defined as ""equal to the amount of virtual currency purchased by users in a given period of time"" (source: company S-1). Therefore, we can expect bookings to be the most widely watched metric every quarterly earnings release, not revenue. DAUs and average bookings per DAU growth are the primary drivers in our valuation model.

**Roblox Cost Profile:** The major Roblox operating costs consist of 

* Cost of revenue - 3rd party payment processing such as Apple and Google app stores - 12.5% of Bookings YTD
* Developer exchange fees - amount earned by developers and creators on the Roblox platform - 16.9% of Bookings YTD

[source: company and our estimates  ](https://preview.redd.it/j4khoil7xr261.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5e4f1d7614e4ca6a02656ae82fdf655b45cfcbb)

As you can see from the chart above, the Loss from Operations has widened significantly the past 4 quarters. However, this is slightly misleading because the company is cash flow positive and the company has been generating more cash flow, not less.

[source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/ub0dbvdaxr261.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=0052285a3da1637689665e1708d86cf482402877)

The reason for this is the method the company uses to recognize revenue vs bookings. On revenue recognition, ""We generally recognize revenue from users ratably over the average lifetime of a paying user, which for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2019 was 23 months. Therefore, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of purchases of Robux during previous periods"" (source: company S-1). And bookings - ""Substantially all of our bookings are generated from sales of our virtual currency **which we record as deferred revenue and then recognize that revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user**"" (source: company S-1).

[source: Company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/zoad08rcxr261.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3a9d7615a3cf3cbd3f35779c598ddf9e97f9fd9)

**So these accounting losses don't necessarily matter** because the company is free cash flow positive. As we can see in the table of bookings and revenue, revenue as a % of bookings declined from 70% in 2019 to 38.4% and 48.8% in Q2 and Q3 2020 respectively. 

**Roblox Growth strategy:** Roblox is focused on four core strategies in order to achieve growth:

* Platform extension: Roblox is continually investing in the platform including in avatars, experiences, technology, and other social features. These efforts can further drive bookings per DAU.
* Age demographic expansion: Roblox and developers are working on building higher quality experiences      and content that appeal to an older age demographic. These efforts can drive DAU growth as well as bookings per DAU as older people don't have to beg mom and dad for their credit card.
* International growth: The JV with Tencent in China is a testament to Roblox's ability to grow      internationally into new markets.
* Further monetization: Roblox is working with their developer community actively to help improve      monetization. Efforts such as Roblox premium being introduced in August 2019 as well as working with leading brands to build unique marketing opportunities on the Roblox platform can further drive monetization.

**Massively Multiplayer Online Gaming Market:** The MMO market has increased rapidly and has hit over 16 million total players. ([source](https://mmo-population.com/charts/players)) We take a look at the market's growth to get a sense of the growth that Roblox may be able to achieve in the near future and beyond. The total number of players dipped in 2019, but the trend is clear with around a 28.5% CAGR in total MMO players over the past 3 years.

[ Source: https:\/\/mmo-population.com\/charts\/players  ](https://preview.redd.it/1u289h9jxr261.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=42b6b45ae0f250d7b671e39c015c3191a4d818de)

We also take a look at the MMO arguably most similar to Roblox, Minecraft. Minecraft is owned by Microsoft and they have released intermittent data points on the number of active players on the platform. The number of active players on Minecraft has increased from 40 million in June 2016 to 126 million as of May 2020. We have only 5 total data points in this time-frame, but this indicates a 33% CAGR over the period and it has accelerated from October 2018 to May 2020. Can Roblox experience a similar level of growth in active players?

**Roblox Forecast:** The basis of our valuation is Bookings per user growth, DAU by region growth, and expenses as a % of Bookings.

Bookings per User have grown 68.6% and 52.5% in Q2 and Q3 y/y, respectively. We think they continue to grow at a high pace in Q4 and Q1 of next year. However, growth will then decelerate as the populations are vaccinated and people start to live their lives as normal once again, thus removing a tailwind for online gaming.

&#x200B;

[source: company S-1](https://preview.redd.it/65tv0bgoxr261.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0e840ee21dfd46a6fe29407791fedf8d2124640)

We have Bookings per user growing 20.6% in 2021, 10% in 2022, 7.5% in 2023, and 5% in subsequent years. For example, this deceleration in each DAU spend gives us a quarterly spend on over $20 a quarter in 2024.

DAUs have grown rapidly during the pandemic, and likewise we expect this growth to decelerate as the pandemic draws to a close. We forecast that Roblox will consolidate its Covid user-base gains, and grow an additional 12.5% in DAUs in 2021, 7.5% in 2022, and 5% every subsequent year. This means that Roblox will pass 50 million DAUs in 2024 and will have close to 60 million in 2030.

We forecast that Roblox's costs and expenses will increase, but as a result of scaling will decrease as a % of Bookings in the future. We anticipate that Roblox will be able to consolidate its cost profile so far experienced in 2020 and will have a cost profile \~60% of Bookings in the future, with the largest contributors to cost being cost of revenue, developer exchange fees, and infrastructure where it is more difficult to create efficiencies through scale.

For some scenario analyses of what the company bookings will be in 2025, we look at different ranges of DAU growth and Bookings per user growth. Roblox currently has averaged 31.1mm DAUs in 2020, and we run scenarios from 22mn to 92mm DAUs in 2025. Likewise, we grow average bookings anywhere from 0% to 17.5% a year. We estimate the likeliest bookings range to be $2.9bn to $5.4bn in 2025, compared to the estimated $1.8bn in bookings for full-year 2020.

**Valuation:** We value Roblox through a Discounted cash flow model with a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8% and a perpetual growth rate of 4%. With these assumptions, we get an equity value per share of around $26.50. With the rumors of Roblox seeking a valuation of \~$8bn [(source)](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/technology/roblox-is-all-but-guaranteed-a-blockbuster-ipo-15496912), we get 114% upside. 

&#x200B;

Just for fun, we run a scenario where we give Roblox decrease DAUs -5% and give 0% growth in bookings per DAU, while keeping the same cost profile, for the final three quarters of 2021 (when the pandemic winds down). We then grow at an anemic rate in DAUs in the future, 5% in 2022 and 2.5% a year onward, we get a price target of \~$18.30 and an equity value close to $12bn.

**Risks to our View:**

Younger audience: With 55.6% of DAUs under the age of 13, how likely is it that they stay on the Roblox platform, we don't have a definitive answer. Kids so young move to the next hottest game very easily and quickly and therefore it is crucial that Roblox continue to capture and keep their attention in order to grow their DAU count.

MMO gaming market competition: An extension of the first risk, the MMO gaming market is incredibly competitive and Roblox will need to continue to innovate and develop its platform to stay ahead of the competition. We aren't aware of any new releases that directly challenge Roblox's position as one of the most widely played games in the world, but new video games and revamps of old games happen all the time. We look forward to seeing how Roblox continues to differentiate itself in the gaming market from competitors and whether these efforts will be successful.

Inability to consolidate Covid user-base gains: Once the pandemic ends will the majority of DAUs gained no longer play Roblox or play/spend less? Our model assumes that the company is able to keep the majority of its DAUs and continue to grow, but this is truly a risk without a real precedent.

**TLDR;** This stock has a very positive story and a lot of price upside if Covid-induced growth can be consolidated and future growth can be achieved. We look to the pricing of the IPO.

What you need to do now is have a plan and know it might take a bit longer. IF you still believe in either of these companies, I mean actually have good understanding of their business and potential catalysts over the next 3-6-9 months then you should reposition into longer dated calls. You will have a good shot to make most of your money back. But it will take time. Don't hold onto your current piece of shit contracts. They are most likely going to 0. Also consider buying some stock. Again wont pay immediately but these companies can still do 100% moves over a relatively short period (6-12 months) or even faster. 

If your butt hole hurts so bad from this beat that the sight of NIO and PLTR gives your hemorrhoids then it's time to do the above strategy into a new ticker all together. Again don't sit on losers too long. If you can extract value do it, but have a plan before you sell anything.

Let me introduce you guys to Dropbox (ticker DBX).

Dropbox is a Cloud computing company with a market cap of 8.2 billion, meaning it's a small cap growth company. We all use cloud, the need for cloud is consistently rising day over day. The need for Cloud is not going away, so what makes Dropbox a buy over the other cloud computing companies?

1. It has a fantastic PE for a growth company. Yes, PE is not the end all be all, but with a forward PE of 19.42 as a growth stock in a hot sector, that is disgustingly undervalued. 
2. It's branding. Their branding and whole repertoire is centralized around small/midsize businesses. It shows the simplicity of using a cloud product. It's becoming a smart workspace in workspaces and schools alike. It is pretty much the only cloud computing company advertising to such. But don't let that make you think they aren't looking big picture, especially their CEO.
3. Their E signing of documents. If you retards think for a second that within the next 5-10 years all signings of documents wont be electronically, then your out of your mind. DBX is one of the few companies in the cloud computing sector doing this too.
4. Their shift in focus. They have started also focusing on the idea of a at home workspace, which I personally love. Although offices and workspaces alike will always love to unnecessarily bring people in just for the purpose of micromanagement, but this pandemic only showed that working from home is the future. I know many of my IC associates have said they will be doing their walkthroughs and meetings through zoom for the benefits. 
5. Their CEO. Drew Houston has been making some moves. He left a busy California city to move to Houston. This move is good for the future of the company, trying to focus on the vision instead of doing business-esch things. 
6. Not a speculative stock. It has beat on earnings for almost every single earnings report and it's revenue has been going up consistently for years. Analyst price targets are also very bullish, with the median prediction being +45% for the next 12 months. They are sitting on over 1.2 Billion dollars of cash, 50 grand is really nothing to a motherfucker like Dropbox. The only speculative thing I can find is that stock twits is outrageously bullish.

Hope you got your  calls cheap EoD today and you didn't paper hand over the past week. We all know nothing goes up in a straight line, especially meme stocks. TSLA has 30% swings to the downside in the past year but is up hundreds of percent. If you look at pretty much any candlestick chart for a meme stock that is currently orbiting the moon you will see this pattern arise.

For those of you too retarded to read Investopedia, this signal is typically a 3 day down trend followed by a down gaped Doji day. A Doji is when a stock opens and closes at approximately the same price with less volatility than normal. This is that. Additionally, if you look at the volume it is up as sales, but the price is constant. This signals that whoever is buying is holding or putting in high limit orders.

The difference is that **I'm not 10 years old.**

It is [SCIENTIFICALLY proven](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-time-seem-to-speed-up-with-age/) that time literally moves faster for children; their heightened metabolism means that they do more biological functions (heartbeats, breaths) per minute compared to adults. Time literally seems to move slower for children because they DO MORE from moment-to-moment on a physiological level.

So before you yell at someone for their inability to understand that the end of the calendar doesn't mean we have **run out of days**, just remember:

Coty bought a 51% stake in Kylie Cosmetics since it wants to step away from stingy boomers and join the Gen Z train. They then doubled down by buying a 20% stake in Kim K‚Äôs KKW beauty. They‚Äôre selling their shitty assets to improve their balance sheet as well. They got rid of their hair products division known as Wella.

Long story short, the business is going for young customers and online growth with influencers. KKR Private equity stepped in and told these losers what to do.

Im here today to talk to you about a company Im really hyped up about called **Momentus**.These guys are doing some really awesome shit out here providing last mile services for space transport, implementing new high-efficiency propulsion technologies for inter-planetary travel and shipping, and they‚Äôre positioning themselves to be in on the GROUND FLOOR of \*Permanent Space Infrastructure\* and the permanent space economy. These guys rule. This is the **first publicly traded space infrastructure company.**

Dont even fucking kid yourself about this: If human beings dont blow themselves into the stone ages, space is \*i n e v i t a b l e\*. We‚Äôre looking at $415Billion in revenue in the space industry currently, with Bank of America projecting the industry to expand upwards of $1.4Trillion in the near future.

As excited as I am about these guys, I‚Äôll do what I can to give you the information I‚Äôve been able to dig up so you can check em out and see if you're interested. I personally think they have some short term hype potential (which I‚Äôll explain later) but Im buying calls now to lock in a price for this company to eventually exercise and hold for the full trip around the fucking moon

**Friends First: Momentus Confirmed Partners**

Currently, Momentus has confirmed and active partnerships or provides services to NASA, Lockheed Martin, and our favorite billionaire meme-lord papa Elon via Space X. They are already confirmed to be participating in the (hopefully) January 14th 2021 first-ever ride share rocket launch in partnership with Space X. They‚Äôre launching 4 different times with Space X in 2021 including an already-booked full vehicle in December of 2021 so they are already out there making plans and getting shit moving. Besides these big names there are many others they have current accounts and partnerships with including Global Ground Station, Relativity, Albaorbital, and others. And just as a little sugar on top, [the President of SpaceX prefers the types of space-tugs offered by Momentus over small rockets](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spacex-president-prefers-space-tugs-over-small-rockets-2020-11-18) (wouldnt mind em giving me a lil space tug myself ifyanowutimsayin)

**The Men Behind the Mission**

The president and founder of Momentus is a man named Mikhail Kokorich. This guy was born in Siberia and studied physics in Russia where he finished his degree with honors while simultaneously starting a company. He has formed and headed several successful companies starting at age 19 with one that provided explosives and chemical services to Siberian mining companies. After that he founded and ran a chain of domestic merchandise retail stores, second in size only to Bed Bath & Beyond, successfully scaled and sold one of the largest consumer electronic retail chains as well as one of the biggest timber companies in the world.. He finally moved back to his childhood dream of building a space company. The rest of their team includes people with previous experience in aerospace, propulsion, and robotics as well as others. Plus, Mikhail is Russian and they beat the US into space so he‚Äôs already got a leg up. Also, Chris Hadfield (the astronaut that did an autistic David Bowie cover from the ISS) is on their Board of Directors, so thats pretty cool.

**The Company, The Vision, The Mission**

Momentus as a company currently has customers for space transportation services including last mile delivery, payload services that will decrease the costs across the board for launching and developing satellites, as well as fixing those puppies up and refueling them \*while they‚Äôre in orbit\*. They have a proven groundbreaking water propulsion technology that is significantly cheaper than any current offerings, is reusable, and is already working since a successful test flight in mid-2019 thats still going to this day. **No pushing the satellite down a hill and turning the camera bullshit here.** They put their money where their mouth is and shot that fucker into space just to prove they could, and its **still going.** Currently they have >$90M of signed contracts and 4 confirmed Vigoride (thats what they‚Äôve named their first model) launches on Space X Flacon-9s. They already have a product roadmap with 3 different models to be offered by 2024 providing both small satellite all the way up to 20,000kg transportation. They will have limited commercial launches starting in the first half of 2021 with full commercial launches going live by Q4 2021. They are compatible with Space X, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, and Relativity with active launch deals signed with all except Blue Origin currently. They‚Äôre also in negotiations for over $1.1B of contracts including with NASA and the US government. Companies like Starlink, Amazon, Apple, and Google already have plans to create their own satellite networks and Momentus is the first in line with proven technology to service all of these future plans with big and long lasting tech players. They have a clear path to profitability and >$1B in EBITDA. Lastly, they‚Äôre already looking to the future and working on plans for in-space solar energy generation, water and resource harvesting from asteroids and other planetary bodies, as well as all sorts of other cool sci-fi shit that (I hope) humans will be capable of before Im fucking dead.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**Momentus is a bleeding-edge space infrastructure and technology company with a successful and passionate founder, a proven currently-in-space revolutionary water propulsion technology, active partnerships with Space X, NASA, and others, and already have good finances and a clear path to profitability and growth. They‚Äôre going public via a special purpose acquisition company with an enterprise value of $1.2B which will later be relisted under the ticker $MNTS.

Momentus was founded by a Russian (the first country in space), already has working partnerships with Papa Elon, and wants to build a future where getting to and moving around in space is cheap, renewable, and profitable. This guys are [going to the fucking moon and back several times on a tiny, water-propellled üöÄ with or without you](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201005408/en/Momentus-Announces-First-Rideshare-Mission-to-Moon), so I‚Äôd suggest you grab a seat early and hold on tight

1. The Senate already passed the bill over the summer, and today It was passed by a democrat run house.

2. The bill aims to make foreign companies let the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board oversee the auditing of their financial records if they want to raise money by selling stocks or bonds to the U.S. public.

3. Many top meme stocks you guys are trading are already independently audited by trusted western auditors. (NIO is independently audited by Price Waterhouse, it says so on their website)

4. This likely wont cause anymore volatility than we‚Äôve seen unless Biden‚Äôs administration goes full retard, since this has many implications for both sides.

#**Sector and Industry**

Garmin Ltd. operates in the technology sector under the scientific & technical instruments industry. The industry has seen [appreciated 21.33%](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name) in the past year. Garmin has slightly outperformed this growth with [23.61% share price appreciation]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN) in the past year. Annual industry earnings growth is [at 7.22% for the last five years]( https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name) with Garmin significantly outperforming at [21.60% in the same time period](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN).

Garmin is the [second largest scientific & technical instruments company](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&f=ind_scientifictechnicalinstruments&o=-marketcap) by market cap, second only to [Fortive Corporation](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FTV). GRMN‚Äôs market cap [currently sits at $22.78B]( https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GRMN). Garmin makes up around 14% of the industry‚Äôs [$168.06B total market cap](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=industry&v=120&o=name).

#**The Company**

Garmin Ltd. offers products in [five main categories](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/profile?p=GRMN): automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness. In 2019, revenues were split between the segments as follows:

Segment|Revenue
:--|:--
Fitness|28%
Outdoor|24%
Aviation|20%
Auto|15%
Marine|13%

The COVID-19 pandemic was a positive catalyst in Garmin‚Äôs marine, outdoor, and fitness categories. Overall, the Company experience a 19% increase in third quarter 2020 revenue, quarter-over-quarter. This is exceptional growth, especially considering Garmin‚Äôs exposure to aviation.

As of the Company‚Äôs [third quarter 2020 earnings call](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf), marine revenues increased 54% quarter-over-quarter on increased consumer interest in boating and fishing. Garmin‚Äôs fitness segment saw a 35% increase in revenue from its wearable and cycling products. Notable, Garmin recently launched the [Venu Sq smartwatch](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/707174). The Company‚Äôs outdoor segment saw revenue increases of 30% with strong sales increases for the [adventure watches](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/outdoor_recreation/adventure-watches/c12520-c16900-p1.html) product line.

Garmin did see decreased revenues it its automotive and aviation operations due to the affects of COVID-19. Automotive revenues decreased 6% in third quarter 2020, compared with the same quarter in 2019. The Company has introduced several exciting new automotive products, including Garmin Catalyst: ‚Äú[an industry first real-time coaching tool designed to optimize track racing performance](https://www8.garmin.com/aboutGarmin/invRelations/reports/2020_Q3_Earnings_Call_Transcript.pdf).‚Äù In the same quarter, the Company became a Tier 1 supplier for BMW automobiles.

The Company‚Äôs aviation segment suffered revenue decreases of 19% due to COVID-19. The Company does not manufacture or sell aircraft itself. However, Garmin does expect aviation sales to fall a further 17%. Increases in owner flown aircraft will help to mitigate some losses. One of Garmin‚Äôs most exciting products in the segment is its Autoland technology.

#**Autoland**

Garmin‚Äôs Autoland is ‚Äú[taking the next step towards autonomous flight](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/)‚Äù by allowing aircraft to be autonomously landed through a single button press. The Autoland system considers environmental factors, chooses a viable airport, communicates with ATC, and then lands the aircraft on an available runway‚Äîall while providing updates to passengers. These updates include location, fuel, destination airport, and arrival time. Garmin‚Äôs research into autonomous landing may remind investors of Tesla, which is developing self-driving capabilities. Garmin‚Äôs Autoland should not be underestimated‚Äîit could become the base for full autonomous flight.

Autoland can only currently be used in emergency situations where the pilot is not capable of landing the aircraft. ‚ÄúAutoland directs the aircraft to a suitable airport nearby for landing based upon a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, weather, terrain, approach, runway and aircraft suitability.‚Äù
In third quarter 2020, the FAA certified Autoland for [use on the Cirrus Vision Jet](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/garmin-autoland-approved-in-cirrus-vision-jet/), adding to its previous certifications for the Piper M600 and Daher TBM 940.

I spoke with a pilot regarding the Autoland technology. He ‚Äúexpects Garmin's new automatic landing systems will be found in most general aviation TAAs [technically advanced aircraft], in the next decade.‚Äù Many pilots around the world share that sentiment, especially during a time of great advancements in autonomous vehicles.

#**Valuation**

Year|Revenue*|EBITDA*|FCF*
:--|:--|:--|:--
2016|$3,018,665|$741,900|$705,682
2017|$3,087,004|$777,691|$660,842
2018|$3,347,444|$882,153|$919,520
2019|$3,757,505|$1,068,560|$698,549

*In thousands of USD; from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/financials?p=GRMN).

Garmin has seen consistent revenue growth in the past five years but the earnings growth is even more impressive at [21.60% annual EPS growth](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Company‚Äôs consistent EPS growth is indicative of its quality management and sustainability. The earnings growth has been priced into the share price at a [PEG of 3.23](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN). It should also be noted that free cash flows have fallen year-over-year amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company remains fiscally healthy with [just $58.42M in debt and cash of $1.65B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRMN/key-statistics?p=GRMN).

Ticker|GRMN
:--|:--
Price|$118.48
Market Cap|$22.78B
P/E|22.51
PEG|3.23
P/S|5.70
Dividend|2.04%

Still, the Company is fundamentally solid and will likely continue to grow. Garmin currently pays a [dividend of $2.44 per share, which is 2.04% of its share price](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=grmn). The Company has increased its dividend payout in the [past eight consecutive years](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GRMN/garmin/dividend-yield-history); this makes it a good candidate for dividend growth investors. Garmin will become a dividend champion in the likely case that its payout increases the next two years.

#**Conclusion**

Garmin has seen immense growth in its marine, outdoor, and fitness segments. The Company‚Äôs investments in its Autoland product have put it at the forefront of autonomous flying. Garmin is a clear innovator in its industry and will likely continue to outperform the overall market.

I personally believe Garmin‚Äôs investments in autonomous flight will make it a leader in the industry, much like Tesla has become in automotive self-driving.

**Tesla for dummies and 5 year olds.** 

1) **Develop software for Grid for trading electricity** \- 

Name is ‚ÄúAutobidder‚Äù. The grid you‚Äôre currently on is using technology that was developed in the 1920s. You gotta build these lines from the source plant to the homes and a significant amount of electricity will be lost in transit. On top of this, the infrastructure has been criminally neglected since 80s in the USA and elsewhere. Do you think these things are maintained? Of course somebody is maintaining them isn‚Äôt it? Nope (only superficially). The California fires that PG&E plead guilty to, that killed about a hundred people in 2018 were a testament to the current state of maintenance that goes on. Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html)

Tesla is building a future where micro grids and macro grids would trade electricity. Imagine your neighborhood with solar on each roof and battery storage in each house. You‚Äôll be trading amongst yourself (neighborhood). And your neighborhood will be trading electricity with the macro grid. This is only possible with a cutting-edge AI powered software. Tesla is building it. Welcome to the glimpse of the future. This is how it will be everywhere. 

&#x200B;

2) **Develop Grid Level Battery Storage**  **‚Äì** In the future the majority of the energy will be obtained from Sun (think of this like indirect fusion source. Sun is a giant fusion reactor in the sky and you‚Äôll be tapping into a microscopic percentage of energy that Sun is sending towards Earth. This microscopic percentage is enough to run the entire civilization which you think utilizes gigantic amount of energy. Everything is relative. So what you‚Äôre really consuming globally is laughable at the relative scale of energy Sun is sending towards your planet. 

Since Sun doesn‚Äôt shine at night, and sometimes it‚Äôs cloudy, you gotta build battery farms to store energy for night. Nothing too complicated conceptually. Tesla is building products known as Megapacks that on the face of it beat Peaker Plants that are powered by fossils in terms of cost, space required, and efficiency. The energy industry is all about cost, so Tesla has won. This revolution has just begun. Testament to Tesla‚Äôs supreme product is Australia which decided to double Tesla‚Äôs battery farm in terms of capacity because it saved them so many millions. The technology has been proven and Tesla is now getting contracts bigger than the previous ones every year. For instance PG&E is currently building the largest battery farm in the US using Tesla‚Äôs Megapacks. This part of their business is going to be equal to auto business within this decade. Future is now, old man. 

&#x200B;

3) **Develop consumer/business level battery storage ‚Äì** You need to have localized power generation and storage as well as grid level. This is the future. For instance, when all 2 billion of the vehicles (as of today) go electric in 30 years, the global electricity requirement is going to double. DOUBLE. So you gotta have localized storage and production. When you‚Äôll buy a new house, a significant part of the cost will be the local storage battery plant. You wouldn‚Äôt buy a house that doesn‚Äôt have its own plant. Tesla is building something known as Tesla Powerwalls. Again, the leading product in its segment, to address this market that has barely begun to develop. This is the future. 

4) **Develop solar panels and solar roofs ‚Äì** Cost of manufacturing solar panels at this point is the cost of doing dry walls. It‚Äôs really cheap and Tesla will ride down the cost curve and be able to compete with Chinese subsidy-fuelled solar panel cost decline. This is because Tesla will be building the solar panels locally in different continents and that would trump over the logistics cost addition of importing from China. So it‚Äôs up to you whether you wanna import from China or get the entire package from Tesla. Barely any difference in cost would exist. 

&#x200B;

The solar roofs do not have competition. This market does not exist. This is a very difficult product to manufacture but every rich person would get it on their roof and eventually everyone. Initially the spurt growth would come from the large builders who‚Äôd be ordering en masse for large-scale projects as well as rich people. Tesla has come out with one design, soon there will be 4 and that‚Äôs that. Tesla will dominate this market which they‚Äôre building from scratch. 

&#x200B;

**5)** **Develop company OS for running the entire company from factory to sales. (They don't use Salesforce, etc.)** **-** So you thought Tesla was using Salesforce? ;) Did you think Tesla was able to achieve the profitability and the margins and the customer satisfaction that they did with the help of Salesforce? ;) For anybody aware of the B2B software, you know how big of a deal this is. Using an industry software that‚Äôs the standard prevents you from iterating quickly over your business processes. You become a slave to the features that exist in these Salesforce like software. Tesla studied all of this in 2012, and gave a public remark that you can still find, that the industry standard software would not be sufficient. They have finally realized their goal of Tesla Company OS. They run everything from factories to sales on this software. They run literally everything that Tesla does on this. This is something that other companies cannot even conceptualize to make because it‚Äôs laughable generally to even think something like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna make our own business software‚Äù. Imagine GM thinking this. On top of this, this Tesla Company OS engineering team is badass and they quickly iterate and add new feature and process whenever required. THIS IS THE REASON TESLA ACHIEVED PROFITIBILITY AND HIGHEST MARGINS. THIS. NOTHING ELSE. THIS SOFTWARE. (But don‚Äôt tell anybody about this, okay? ;) )   
   
 

**6)** **Selling Insurance Products ‚Äì** Oh no, Warren. He once famously said when asked about Tesla insurance ‚Äúan auto company is about as likely to succeeed in insurance business as an insurance company is likely to succeed in auto business‚Äù. Little did he understand insurance of automobiles of the future. Tesla has all the data with regards to your cars. More data than any other insurance company can ever have. Tesla has 360\* camera data, vehicle sensor logs, etc. All of this is proprietary. You can maybe gain access to GPS and front-cam via dash camera if you‚Äôre a 3rd party insurance company, but you cannot compete with Tesla on the magnitude and diversity of data that Tesla has. Getting into insurance is a difficult process, but Tesla will prevail and eventually offer it everywhere. They‚Äôre currently offering it in California only. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**7)** **Develop RNA microfactories for vaccines ‚Äì** As per Elon, he doesn‚Äôt expect this to be a big product from a finance stand-point but they‚Äôre developing these machines to build cutting-edge vaccines. You can solve diseases like it‚Äôs a software problem and who knows how much Tesla will decide to get into this market. They‚Äôve currently partnered with CureVac in Germany. Remember Bill Gates saying that Elon doesn‚Äôt know anything about vaccines? Well, he‚Äôs an idiot. Because Tesla is partnered with CureVac ‚Äì a company BILL GATES IS INVESTED IN TO BUILD VACCINES. IT IS ELON WHO IS MAKING THE MACHINES THAT BUILDS VACCINES FOR BILL GATES. Idiot, consumed by jealousy. Next.   
   
 

**8)** **Materials engineering for alloys used for making their vehicles ‚Äì** Oh no‚Ä¶Oh no. The material engineering is one of the most difficult things to do on this planet. There simply aren‚Äôt people smart enough to even understand basics of it. Testament to this? THE TEAM THAT DOES MATERIALS ENGINEERING FOR SPACEX is the same team that does it for Tesla. Why? Nobody else knows how to do it. Please contact Tesla if you know how to do it. These alloys add to the advantage of safety and weight of their vehicles. Furthermore, the armor glass which will be built of Cybertruck is not something you can just buy off the self. This is the latest thing they‚Äôre building. Don‚Äôt tell anybody that Tesla uses its own alloys. This is a secret between you and I. ;) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**9)** **Develop next-gen capital machinery for their next-gen factories ‚Äì** Why do you think Tesla acquired the Grohmann Automation? They keep making these acquisitions but nobody wants to pay attention. The vehicles that are coming off the lines require machinery that doesn‚Äôt exist - for manufacturing. Tesla does this in-house. An exception to this is the giant casting machines that are being purchased from Italy. On the whole, Tesla is bringing the dawn of automotive manufacturing revolution finally in 2021. The sheer re-imagining of car manufacturing is a little scary for the rest of the industry so they want to ignore this. Model Y that will be built in 2021 in Germany will be structurally different from the one in USA and China. This is because of the giant casting machines. Anyway, so the bottom line is Tesla is reimagining how manufacturing is done and this sounds simple but is a monumental thing that nobody else wants to embark on. Those companies like VW do something known as catalog engineering. This is when you buy a catalogue magazine and order the machines with pretty pictures. Then you are slave to the machines that you‚Äôve purchased for manufacturing cars. Elon has repeatedly said since 2 years, that Tesla‚Äôs long term advantage is not software (it is not the #1 according to him) but rather manufacturing. How can this be? Isn‚Äôt Tesla a noob? Well, people are in for a surprise. Tesla is going to out-manufacture the rest of the industry. You cannot beat this advantage. Other companies literally won‚Äôt have the machines that Tsla is using to build their vehicles. How do you compete?   
   
 

**10)**  **Develop FSD Compuer Chip (their own silicon like Apple's M1) ‚Äì** So we‚Äôre talking about industry leading inference chip that is based on an important concept of redundancy. There are two redundant CPUs in there because of which you‚Äôre fine if one fails. You can run FSD software locally and very safely. This is cryptographically signed, so you cannot just reverse-engineer it and put it in your copy-cat car. No chip competes with Tesla‚Äôs in terms of the wattage consumed and in terms of compute ability. FSD requires a great inference computer and while this capacity hasn‚Äôt been yet full utilized as the chip is too strong and software still nascent, it will be soon. Nvidia has promised to come out with ‚Äúbetter chip‚Äù next to next year but alas, by the end of 2021, Tesla would be coming out with the next gen FSD Inference Computer Chip. This will already beat anything that is in development right now. They win again on the in-car computer. Now you would like to think only in terms of compute advantage, but think deeply about wattage problem. The more the chip consumes the less the car has range. Tesla‚Äôs range doesn‚Äôt just come from the best-in-industry motors but from a lot of places. FSD computer is one great contributor to the high overall range. Other companies will be using third party stuff that will be generalized and power hungry. Ouch. They lose again. On fundamentals, let‚Äôs not even talk about compute

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**11)**  **Develop Super-Computer with proprietary silicon for neural network training like Google's TPU** **- ""Tesla Dojo""** **-** So this is something the industry hadn‚Äôt even conceptualized because they were debating whether Lidar is good or bad. Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer that will be on the exaFlop level. This is not something that anybody can just venture into. Tesla is building their own silicon for this and this computer will be live next year (towards end). In order to achieve FSD you need to turn road driving into a game. You gotta make everything from collection of data to processing and training neural networks to updating cars automatic. This is not currently possible. But Tesla will make it possible with this computer. THIS IS A GOD DAMN SUPER COMPUTER LITERALLY SUPER COMPUTER that is BETTER THAN WHAT IS OUT THERE. The current TOP SUPER COMPUTER is ABOUT HALF THAT OF 1 exaFLOP. Good luck competing with this. Also, Google and AWS have been put on watch because Elon publically said that this computer is going to be offered as AWS-like service as well. Please continute debating Lidar while Elon takes over the world via this Skynet Cyberdyne System.   
   
 

**12)**  **Mine lithium ‚Äì** Hold your horses, it‚Äôs getting a little crazy. Tesla just purchased 10,000 acres in Nevada to mine lithium using Table Salt. TABLE SALT. So well, they‚Äôve already come up with a revolutionary way to mine lithium and they will be more efficient therefore save more on cost. So they‚Äôll have this interesting advantage. Obviously, eventually, they‚Äôll move into more aspects of mining and and processing and keep on increasing their cost advantage.

**13)**  **Manufacture cells, modules, batteries ‚Äì** Please refer to the Battery Day Presentation, they will dominate. They‚Äôre going to be structurally putting the batteries in the structure of the vehicles itself. What this means is that there won‚Äôt be battery boxes inside your car, but rather that battery cells will be integrated as part of the car structure. This is the transition that occurred in planes. The fuel is now part of the wings. This was earlier not the case. The dry electrode technology that Tesla is going to be using in their cells is going to get rid of the ovens that are required. This in and of itself is going to enable them to have terawatt level manufacturing since you need such a small space and your process speed is increased by many multiples. There is no way to explain cells without going technical so just know this that Tesla‚Äôs cells are going to be the industry leading. They won‚Äôt be able to produce them enough for a very long time so initially these will be put into their higher-end vehicles.

**The rest of the points are self-explanatory.**

403,Extra tendies from TD Ameritrade,7,k5neoh,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5neoh/extra_tendies_from_td_ameritrade/,27,"I've been doing a lot of day trading on TD Ameritrade and I've noticed a rather peculiar discrepancy that has earned me a few extra tendies on high volume stonks, and I wanted to share. Hopefully someone can explain exactly why this occurs, still extra tendies regardless though.


I've noticed this with all of my recent trades:


- When I make an order to purchase shares at 'market', I end up paying a much HIGHER price than the actual market value displayed.


But 


- When I make a purchase using a limit (using the limit provided by the broker based off the current market value at the time of purchase (because I wanna buy asap), not a manually set one), I seem to pay a much LOWER price than the actual market value displayed. 


In addition to this finding, I've noticed


- Whenever I sell shares at 'Market', I end up selling the share at a noticeably higher price than what the displayed market value was at the time of purchase.


But


- Whenever I would try to sell using a limit (again, set by the broker based off the current market value at the time of the sale (because I don't want to wait a bit for it to be sold), not a manually set limit), I end up selling the share at the lowest possible amount closest to my limit. 


***Example:***
(these numbers are estimates, though they closely resemble the original numbers. I just don't have the exact data saved).


Buying at market: 


I was day trading shares of a certain stock, I made an order for 600 shares at market value ($0.781) but when the trade processed, I ended up purchasing the shares at $0.792. This discrepancy led to me starting my trade down $6.60.


Buying at TD's market value based limit:


I was day trading shares of the same stock, I made an order for 600 shares using the base limit TD Ameritrade filled in (based off the current market value)($0.781). When the trade processed, I ended up purchasing the shares at $0.775. This discrepancy led to me starting my trade up $3.60.


Selling at market: 


After riding the wave, I notice the share value starting to hint at decline and I decide to close my position. I make a sell order for my 600 shares at market value ($0.812), but they ended up actually selling for $0.819. This discrepancy led to me closing my position with an extra gain of $4.20.


Selling at TD's market value based limit:


Shredded the 'nar, now I want to close my position and lock in those sweet sweet tendies. I make a sell order for my 600 shares using the base limit TD Ameritrade filled in (based off current market value)($0.812). These shares ended up selling at $0.813, leading to an extra gain of $0.60.


Based off of this example, if I had bought these 600 shares using the TD base limit, and sold at 'Market, I would have an extra tendies gain of $7.80.


Now the case can obviously be made that perhaps the market simply changed during the time it took me to close my position, to which I would agree. BUT I've been experimenting with this ""discrepancy"" for hours, and through over 30 seperate day trades - and my results have remained constant. If it was due ONLY to the market changing, then wouldn't at least a few of the results be reversed?


I'm not an expert by any means and I have no idea why it works in this way, but I was intrigued and wanted to share my findings."

**Current Market Cap**: $1.2B & $7 stock price

Too much to read? Well fuck it, just skim below.

**Products and % of Revenue:**

Current YTD Revenue: $612M

Large Driver ICs (**LDDICS**) - 23.2%; down 6.3% vs Last Quarter)

Small & Med Driver ICs (**SMDDICS**) - 63.2%; up 53.5% vs Last Quarter)

Non-Driver Products - 13.6% (up 13.3% vs Last Quarter)

**\[Himax\] Forecast of Products:**

What I really wanted to focus on was their products and future guidance for Q4:

**LDDICS**

\+Q4: Revenue increase high single digits (QoQ)

\+Everyone in school/working at home on their laptops and shit) --> Increased monitor & notebook sales

\-Decline in TVs; As a result of COVID --> massive spike in TV buys from previous quarter so now everyone has a new ballin' TV

\+Himax‚Äôs Tcon revenue in the fourth quarter limited by capacity shortage in IC packaging due to competing demands from 5G chipsets is on track to increase by more than 20% (QoQ). This will represent more than 40% increase annually.

\*TCON = Timing controller

More info: [https://www.himax.com.tw/products/other-display-related-semiconductor-solutions/timing-controllers/](https://www.himax.com.tw/products/other-display-related-semiconductor-solutions/timing-controllers/)

**SMDDIC**

\+Q4: revenue expected to increase double digits (QoQ) as demand > supply. Issue: capacity shortage which may not be resolved for a while.

\+Expected to gain market share in 2020 & 2021

\+Company's smartphone TDDI revenue is projected to have a nice double digit increase in Q4

\-Traditional display driver ICs for smartphone after spiking Q3 is set to decline double digit in Q4.

?Company highly invested in AMOLED technology and believes it will be a huge growth engine for SMDDIC business in 2021.

\+Tablet TDDI is ballin'. Increase of up to 80% (QoQ) expected for Q4. Believe it is a tremendous upside as Himax is a leading supplier for all major Android names.

\-Expected decline for tradition tablets QoQ, but still better than YoY previous numbers.

\+Car Panel Driver ICs hit hard by COVID, but recovering as car sales come back. Important to note: Much bigger gross margins on these and gradually bouncing back. More of these new technologies in place for 2021.

**Non-Driver Product Categories**

**WLO**

\-Declined as main customer lost sales, but will continue to produce

\+Still enaging and developing future generation products (ToF 3D sensing, waveguide for AR goggles, biomedical devices, and others)

**3D Sensing**

\+Targeting next gen Android phones

\+Few design wins from China's e-payment market actually, with shipments already starting in Q4

\+Working with customers for industrial robotics, smart door lock and home security, also.

**Ultralow power smart sensing**

\+Himax sees this as huge potential for the total package they hope to offer in the future. Just read the financial report because I'm getting lazy here

**CMOS Image Sensor**

\-Bad capped by foundry shortage, more when this shit ain't happening or gets better, chief

**\[Himax\] Future Guidance (Q4 2020):**

**Net Revenue**: To increase by around 10% (QoQ yet again, if you cucks can't tell by now).

\+This was their highest revenue in a single quarter in the past 12 years.

\+**Gross Margin**: To be around 29%, depending on final product mix. Previous Gross Margin by quarter:

2020 Q3 - 21.73%, 2020 Q2 - 20.96%, 2020 Q1 - 20.63%, 2019 Q4 - 20.57%

\-They have been much higher in the past. late 2000s.

**IFRS Profit**: To be around 15.0 cents to 16.0 cents per diluted ADS

**Non-IFRS Profit** (1): To be around 15.1 cents to 16.1 cents per diluted ADS"

While record breaking FBI Gun Background Checks are but an indicator of increased $AOUT revenue, it‚Äôs an indicator that I am taking to the bank. I bought 325 shares for $13.75.

AOUT reports earnings on 12/15/2020 and last earnings report on 09/03/2020 resulted in the following:

Non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 beats by $0.56; GAAP EPS of $0.13 beats by $0.34. Revenue of $50.47M (+51.9% Y/Y) beats by $9.4M. E commerce net sales grew 130%, while traditional channel net sales rose 15%. Shares +6.3%

Moreover management has been [buying up shares](http://openinsider.com/AOUT)

Another great indicator are the record background checks. Last years November gun background checks came in at 2,574,752. This year was significantly higher. Last data was released on October 31st and beat the previous years checks by nearly a million!! This November beat last year by nearly 1.1 million.

See the background check data chart [HERE](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view)

Finally SPWH released their earnings today. [Sportsman's Warehouse dazzles with 41% comparable sales jump as consumers camp, hunt and fish](https://investors.sportsmans.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sportsmans-warehouse-holdings-inc-updates-guidance-fourth) Note: SPWH sells a bunch of AOUT products. Look up the above brands on their website. Additional companies that smashed earnings that sell AOUT products are DKS & BGFV. 

AOUT is on a pullback and trading on the cheap (Below Book Value Per Share). Earnings on 12/15 and I‚Äôm betting on a solid beat. This stock has a very low float of only 12 million shares. So AOUT can swing hard on news.

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)

If you own your shares for cash (no margin loan), you can ask your broker to move them from a margin account to a cash account. Others can chime in here too, but my understanding is if this happens, they are no longer lendable without your explicit permission.

This is the retail version of an institution recalling their shares from a lender. If they're no longer lendable, they're no longer shortable and if enough shares are held in cash, shorts are called to cover.

431,Dish hopefully loses 160+ channels tonight.,12,k5iiht,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5iiht/dish_hopefully_loses_160_channels_tonight/,23,"DISH a satellite TV provider. They are up 42% this last month to $36.89. Today their contract expires with Nextar. They have been negotiating and claim Nextar is the devil and is raising prices too high. This could cause exponential customer loss, stock plummet.

Dish also got into a bidding war and overpaid for SPECTRUM wireless contracts they spent roughly 20 bn to aquire. This was earlier in the decade. However, the time is running out and they have yet to produce the build-out requirements for these by the FCC. The march 2020 deadline already passed and the next step is them failing to meet the 2023 deadline. They will face a 72 million dollar penalty should they fail.

The bull case here is that sprint and t-mobile merger failed and that Dish received an upgrade to Buy by some analysis because they predict Verizon may want to purchase these contracts for their network so that t-mobile does not obtain it.

Backstory, I have done work for Dish and they are horrible. Dish loses 671K customers annually. Currently with somewhere around 13.9 million. They also own Sling TV which is terrible and loses large amounts annually. The representatives that enter your home are micromanged into selling a minimum of $34 a job of upcharges on anything from HDMI Cables to full sound systems or smart home devices.

Dish has cut a huge amount of internal and external workforce this year amongst COVID-19 as well as raising the requirements for technicians to sell more. COVID may have brought in more temporary customers but with this blackout and more annual customer loss than their competitors I see this a potential shockwave into bear territory for the company if they fail to make a deal.

Something to keep an eye on, I would absolutely love to throw some PUTS on this one.

Update:
I spoke with ‚Äúmy guy‚Äù and he said it‚Äôs misleading somewhat. 160 channels is nationwide loss. A given area like Your Town May only lose a fraction of that amount based on what channels are with that provider in Your Town. 
He said it will cost a lot of money as dish then offers free over the air antennas with install (they‚Äôre usually like $120?) in this situation to compensate. That could hurt the profit margin depending on how wide of an area and how long this goes for. The customer usually pays $12.99 for locals so each customer receiving one could drop the local pack. 


They have already lost channels 8 and 23, and a couple others before today. I have yet to find out which channels are gone now or how the meeting went. 

Hope to see some gigantic drops on the stonk just because.

Update: ‚ÄúAbout 5.4 million Dish customers are being hit by the carriage impasse. Nexstar‚Äôs station portfolio now includes top markets like LA, Chicago and New York as well as dozens of other cities.

I am aware that some of you have curious as to why RKT has not taken off already. I wish to know too. I sent some info analysis to an elder of mine who has been showing me some things that he has learned over his decades of investing and he sent me the following reply. 

I hope to get some thoughts on this reply. 

‚ÄúMy reactions to Rocket Mortgage are:
1.If all goes well like their predictions these would be good returns BUT
2. In the 2008 crash one strategy was for a big organization to form a separate mtge
company, and sell the stock in this separate corporate entity. Then the new entity loaded up
with second rate mortgage risks (which of course paid higher interest rates) which the shareholders could (from a practical point of view) not really evaluate. When many of these mortgage borrowers went south and could not pay this had a major impact on the profitability of the overall return of the portfolio of mortgages. This then had a dramatic  effect on the price of the mtge company stock, The losses did not affect the big organization which also benefited from all the underwriting fees which indirectly were paid for by the mtge company shareholders. Many of these holders would not have invested in low quality, high risk mortgages directly if they had known the level of risk they would be running. There is plenty of boilerplate (cover-my-posterior) language in the fine print of what you sent me.‚Äù (Here he is talking about the analysis report I sent him)

‚Äú3. Will the Biden administration promote a booming economy with more regulations and higher taxes?
If the economy slows down the first to suffer will be these lower grade mtge's. I personally don't like
complexity when it can be avoided by a more direct approach. Of course, if interest rates are high enough
an organization can survive even knowing that a number of lenders will fail along the way. Loan sharks
have played this game forever. Maybe that is not what they are doing here but I see no references stating that Rocket is seeking only high quality lending risks--the kind JPM is glad to issue loans to itself.
I may be wrong but I did not get a ""good feeling"" reading this material. All these so called certified
evaluators have (as pointed out) some conflicts of interest because they are paid by JPM, What does
an independent evaluator who sells only info to its customers and has no advertising or other relationship
with a ""Rocket"" think? Probably no one is covering this entity so you will never know.Do you want to be
a high interest rate money lender to a group of higher risk borrowers? If so, Rocket might be just the ticket.‚Äù"

They have a 226.2 BILLION dollar market cap.

They make  Lipitor which all of us probably need after yoloing our life savings into PLTR.They also make a drug our wife's boyfriends routinely dont need -Viagra

But the biggest question I have... why arnt we riding PFE to TendieTown.They literally are a massive pharma company with experience dealing in international regulations..Theyve partnered with BionTech and just got APPROVAL to use their COVID VACCINE IN THE UK NEXT WEEK

[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55145696](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55145696)

Literally even Delta is riding their wave back to life  and have altered flights to deliver their vaccine by storing it in dry ice.

Moderna went up 70% to 170$ and only dipped because of serious profit taking because Merck cashed out at like a 650% gain (i think i saw they made over a billion in gainz)

PFE and Moderna are safe bets. PFE a safer bet. Look at headlines. Literally the governors of California and North Carolina have already said how thankful and blessed they are that they are getting a few hundred thousand vaccines from Pfizer and Illinois is about to follow suit.

PFE literally has a meeting for vaccine drug approval with the FDA on December 10.They are experienced, they are financially secure, and they are already making and distributing the vaccine. UK already approved their vaccine, the FDA will follow suit and PFE will make us serious money.

459,Copper is the new gold,19,k5cmeb,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5cmeb/copper_is_the_new_gold/,39,"Not sure why nobody is talking about copper here but it's red hot right now and is entering a commodity super cycle.

* China (uses half of copper in the world) has recovered from the pandemic fully and has imported record amount of copper this year

* People speculate on EV companies like crazy but regardless of which EV companies end up dominating the market and which ones go bankrupt, copper wins.  Each electric vehicle uses 3.5 times more copper than combustion vehicle.  An electrical bus uses 11-16 times more copper than a conventional bus.   Super charger stations needs copper.  Any green infrastructure will require a lot of Cooper.

Goldman thinks copper price may break the 2011 record by second half of 2022.  https://www.ft.com/content/36fe5230-e24f-4fbf-8690-fd211f655347

So what to buy wise, I looked through a dozen big cap producers and jr miners.  Most  mine too many other metals and some own a lot of copper underground but digging up maybe a challenge for environmental/political reasons.  What's left are FCX, SCCO, and HBM.

Back in 2010-2011 when copper price broken record last, FCX traded over $56 ($23.68 right now), SCCO traded around $46 ($60.38 now so maybe not cheap), HBM traded around $17 ($6.78 now).

I have been buying FCX shares for 6 months, just started buying options last couple days.  Right now I have

* 2000 shares of FCX

* 50 contracts of HBM Jan21 7.5C

* 50 contracts of FCX Jan21 30C

* 20 contracts of HBM July21 10C

That's over $50K of positions in copper producers but I may buy some FCX leaps soon too.  The 2021 options maybe more of a moon shot unless copper price spikes a lot sooner than expected."

This is the last coffin in the nail for NKLA, they are completely done for.

Yet, we hear our lord and savior Paul Coster say this,

{On Wall Street, two analysts who cover Nikola disagreed on what the scaled-down GM agreement means. J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster maintains an overweight rating on the stock.

""We think this is a positive outcome for Nikola over the medium to longer term, since the company can now focus on the core Class 8 truck initiative and avoid the distraction and [capital expenditures] associated with the Badger,"" Coster said in an investor note.}-[link.](https://pub.webull.com/us/news-html/3de4184e223f46448f8f09bdf66a2e4e.html?theme=2&_v=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1&_v=1&theme=2&color=1&hl=en)

In October he said this,
{J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster calls it ‚Äúa compelling strategy.‚ÄùHowever, Coster also points out Nikola‚Äôs near-term success hinges on GM signing on the dotted line.‚ÄúWe think the GM partnership deal is the most important near-term catalyst,‚Äù Coster said. ‚ÄúFailure to consummate the GM deal would be a fatal blow for the Badger initiative, but a serious blow to the more important Truck initiative too, in our view. The fuel station partnership announcement is less important, in our view, though a potential validation of the company that could resonate with investors. Pending completion of the five Nikola Tre trucks could be a boost to credibility, obviously‚Ä¶ For now, the GM partnership is a stress-test for the company.‚ÄùCoster remains positive on Nikola and keeps an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating along with a bullish $41 price target.}-[link.](http://www.shippipedia.com/nikola-stock-will-surge-70-from-current-levels-says-analyst/)
Did you just read that? He has a price target of $41. 

Again, what he said yesterday kinda completely contradicts with what he said in October.

2 years ago he have had such a [low rating(screenshot of a screenshot)](https://imgur.com/a/kTSmcxW) that I find it surprising that he has almost come to [3 stars.](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/paul-coster)

Of course, he probably has inherent interest to see NKLA go above its current price. For this he doesn‚Äôt give a f**k if people buy into his arguments and jump on board on this stock.

I guess he wants just a dead cat bounce so that he could save his ass and make sure that retail investors become the ultimate bagholders of this company.

There are many other analysts like that in the Street and I don‚Äôt know how they remain in business for so long. But my main point is that be careful before you jump into a stock. 

Some of you probably just see an average analyst price target, see a stock is undervalued or overvalued and jump to trade it. I mean according to analyst estimates NKLA would be a kind of a good deal in this overvalued market. But we all know that this company's stock is ultimately going to $0(probably within next year)."
475,"SNOWflake's business explained, no jargon",12,k5cz1t,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5cz1t/snowflakes_business_explained_no_jargon/,25," SNOWflake earnings come out today! Regardless of results, I want to try explaining what SNOW does in layman's terminology so everyone can have an understanding.

I work at a Fortune 100 company, leading a tech team. I've seen a lot of companies start investing in SNOWflake to scale their digital and analytical capabilities. Here's a summary of what they do:

¬∑ Snowflake solves for a really important problem in Corporate America's IT, where IT is constantly under pressure to deliver the most value with the least amount of work. 

¬∑ Here's an analogy for what SNOW does - imagine you had important customer data that will allow you to figure out who are the most profitable customers (so you can tell your sales reps to focus on those leads first). However, that data is spread amongst multiple tables in different file formats such as Word, Excel, and PDF. You need a simple way to consolidate that data in order to make sense out of it. SNOW enables that - we can take data from multiple sources such as big cloud platforms like Amazon web services and Microsoft, and combine it with internal on-premise data so we can have one consolidated structured / semi-structured data set so all your data scientists can understand how one data point (e.g., age, education level) correlates with profitability.

This is why [salesforce.com](https://salesforce.com/) and Warren Buffet invested in SNOW, because SNOW makes life easy, enable all the analytics that corporations are looking for, and allows partners like Salesforce to overcome any internal IT resource constraints that they are selling their services to. The buzzwords you all hear about from Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence, are all reliant on having the right data infrastructure in place. Regardless of how earnings today, this is a long term play if you believe that all corporations are investing in this space. Earnings come out today! 

Hope this helps, I'm curious if others have better analogies or simpler ways to explain the business!

Edit position : my cost basis in SNOW is $28,901"

478,The Gang Takes on Nat Gas,4,k5hy9m,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5hy9m/the_gang_takes_on_nat_gas/,18,"I would like to dedicate this research to the oil trader that made a bill shorting Nat Gas after a hurricane and the kid in my stats class for igniting this idea.

Alright, listen up Fireman, Austismos, Goons, Gigolos, and Spooks alike we are taking on the Global Energy markets today. Skip to comments for TLDR. Our emphasis will be on how US Homes are heated. With patriotism and pandemic numbers in full swing, President-Elect Biden may attempt to slow the US Economy, pushing families into homes. Don‚Äôt debate this in the comments, debate if your local sheriff‚Äôs department has the funding and resources, and willingness to uphold this.

Let‚Äôs begin at your new favorite three-letter agency EIA; our journey with understanding and defining how the U.S. Energy Information Administration defines what makes up our statistics.

* **Residential** sector includes homes and apartments.
* **Commercial** sector includes offices, malls, stores, schools, hospitals, hotels, warehouses, restaurants, and places of worship, and public assembly.
* **Industrial** sector includes facilities and equipment used for manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and construction.
* **Transportation** sector includes vehicles that transport people or goods, such as cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, trains, aircraft, boats, barges, and ships.

All global energy markets revolve around these sectors. With Petroleum (Oil for the Canadians) providing roughly 37%, Natural Gas 32%, Renewable 11% (kewk), Coal 11% (Trump 2020), and Nuclear at a dismal 8%. Honestly, side note why the fuck are homes still heated on Nat Gas, Electric and not Nuclear? Idk im retarded. Wait its because Nat Gas and Oil are big swinging dicks in this bracket. For those keeping score that‚Äôs +1 for Globalism and Capitalism, Science and Commies 0.

Data is a bit dated ;) at 2015 but it‚Äôs the best we got from the EIA

So moving along here you see Nat Gas and Electric as make up about 80% of the market. What provides that you ask?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ut1wcxdp4u261.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=76628660c9fba96d72f3f01ebb405cf83977bb41

Ok now, 44% of homes are heated with Natural Gas based energy which is highly efficient only consuming 16% of Nat Gas reserves, while 41% are heated by relying on the power grid; which is powered with an additional 36% of the United States Nat Gas. So in total United States homes consume about 52% of US Nat Gas markets.

Here is an [article](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=45716) from the EIA starting to expect greater consumption this winter than in previous years. Posted Nov. 2, 2020

Within this article, they state we should expect consumers to spend 6% more on their winter bill than last winter. Also, producer costs are down 2% year over year. (lockdowns in cold climates were already in effect, for some of the ‚Äúwinter‚Äù)

Moving on to transportation and oil markets, 91% of transportation is powered by oil. Think, global shipping lines, domestic holiday shipping, domestic general goods shipping, and the biggest contributor that provides all of these things, airlines. Personally, I‚Äôm staying out of this portion due to a diverse set of market forces acting on global shipping markets. Tanker gang rises up tho.

Screenshot from EIA [article](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/where-our-natural-gas-comes-from.php) is shown above has Texas and Pennsylvania produce almost 40% of our Nat Gas

In conclusion and with the understanding that, United States Nat Gas companies out produce all other nations what are the tickers you want to look at?

EQT- Largest Pennsylvania based Nat Gas producer technical point to price spike maybe $25 EOY (just the start of winter)

PXD- Largest Texas-based Nat Gas producer $160 EOY

XOM- I didn‚Äôt look into oil production vs Nat Gas but Texas based. $50 EOY"

480,From the Scientist who posted the NVAX DD: Updates about recent COVID Vaccine news and today's price action for $NVAX & $MRNA,83,k5464b,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5464b/from_the_scientist_who_posted_the_nvax_dd_updates/,42,"I've gotten numerous questions about what to make of the last few trading days for $NVAX, as well as $MRNA and $BNTX so I thought it might be useful to give an update on recent developments in the COVID vaccine race and how I'm interpreting them. 

I've already made two long posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k35zlh/followup_dd_from_an_actual_scientist_about_nvax/)) about why I think NVAX is the best vaccine stock and as of today have over 60k invested in stocks/options (proof at the end) so I'm not gonna try to pretend that I'm not biased towards NVAX. 

But with that in mind, I still thought this might help NVAX/MRNA/BNTX holders because I think the next month is gonna to be crazy for all three stocks (less so PFE/JNJ/AZN) and I don't know of too many good sources of information for the typical retail investor.

&#x200B;

**Today's action**

https://preview.redd.it/klvnkgq07p261.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=764ddb3dca038a8382c83f4baf5e7724b3659498

I think today was just a pullback from the big moves over the last few days bc I couldn't find anything that would have cause all three stocks to drop. Please let me know if I'm missing something.

Although all three stocks followed the same pattern at the start of the day, MRNA's selloff seemed to accelerate right around 12:30pm, which coincided with an interview of Moderna's President Stephen Hoge as part of the Evercore ISI annual health conference ([webcast link](https://wsw.com/webcast/evercore11/mrna/2356374); requires name and email to view video). I don't know if the two things are related, but comments he made during the interview were picked up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b4nj6sfv9p261.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e35b8a2b3b91782bb2e12fc2d3b145118111bd2

Whether or not I'm overinterpreting the two events, there were a couple of important things that came up during the interview that might be of interest for MRNA holders:

1. In my first post, I talked about how the 95% efficacy for MRNA that's been widely circulated only refers to prevention of symptomatic disease and not prevention of infection. Well this was the opening topic and I wonder whether this was the first time some people realized that the reported 95% efficacy didn't refer to infections and prompted an overreaction. I think Hoge did a good job in navigating the questions and made it clear that they'll be reporting that data as a secondary endpoint from the trial.
2. Manufacturing capacity was another big topic and Hoge said that the upper end of the 500M to 1B doses they're estimating for 2021 isn't going to happen unless everything goes perfectly. He said that the 500M estimate was more reasonable and to my ear seemed to be hedging quite a bit, making me question whether 500M is going to be difficult to achieve.
3. They expect to have 20M doses by the end of the year
4. No safety issues have been observed and we know that the vast majority of safety issues with other vaccines present within the first few weeks (can't remember the exact timeframe).

&#x200B;

[This](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-janssens-covid-19-vaccine-ad26cov2s) was the only other thing that I could find that may have impacted NVAX/MRNA/BNTX:

https://preview.redd.it/b2eqpfyvdp261.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d371b1d37789aaac21b5e1ab1d0cbe0d999242

I haven't spent a lot of time talking about JNJ, as their Phase 3 trial was halted in October due to a case of transverse myelitis and everything I've read suggests that they're not going to be able to apply for emergency use authorization until mid-1Q 2021. I have to get more caught up on JNJ to figure out the implications of their progress, but my impression until now has been that they're behind. That however might not be the case outside of the US, and if so, maybe this news was relevant for NVAX/MRNA/BNTX. I'm skeptical bc I saw almost zero discussion of this, but I think it warrants some consideration. 

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Important Upcoming Catalysts

&#x200B;

**Emergency use authorization announcements**

https://preview.redd.it/46ib0ermgp261.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4277928982b4a55ee00ae31a97ce48ae26610db

[Link](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article247526955.html). I think this is just an attempt to reassure the public that they're not going to take any shortcuts. I think it's extremely unlikely that both of the mRNA vaccines don't get emergency use authorization given their high efficacy rates and reportedly good safety profiles in the middle of a pandemic. We'll know based on the AdComm meetings on December 10th for PFE/BNTX and December 17th for MRNA. 

This is obviously a positive catalyst for MRNA/BNTX, but I have no idea how much they'll run-up to the announcement and how much of them getting approval is already priced in. As far as how this impacts NVAX, I think we might see a small pullback if positive announcements but I honestly have no idea what will happen. I tend to think this won't matter much for NVAX since it's been clear for a long time that they're behind PFE/MRNA.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Reactogenicity of mRNA vaccines** 

Something that I think is completely off the radar but I think is going to be a huge deal within the next month is the fact that mRNA vaccines have significantly more reactogenicity than the vaccines most people are used to. Reactogenicity includes symptoms like injection site pain, swelling, fever, and fatigue; symptoms that are unpleasant but not dangerous. 

If you're an investor in MRNA/BNTX, don't shrug this off. This [article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6520/1022) published in Science is what convinced me there's trouble ahead and this can't be ignored:

https://preview.redd.it/3x3lxf9klp261.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a89fca405b51b1bafcb3e9fccebd11f870bbd39

Here are a couple of quotes from the article:

&#x200B;

>... after the second injection, his arm swelled up to the size of a ‚Äúgoose egg,‚Äù ...  within a few hours, Hutchison, who was healthy and 43, was beset by bone and muscle aches and a 38.9¬∞C fever. ‚ÄúI started shaking. I had cold and hot rushes,‚Äù he says. ‚Äú**I was sitting by the phone all night long thinking: ‚ÄòShould I call 911**?‚Äô‚Äù   
>  
>  
>  
>Hutchison's symptoms resolved after 12 hours. But, he says, ‚Äú**Nobody prepared me for the severity of this**.‚Äù He says the public should be better prepared than he was, because a subset of people may face intense, if transient, side effects, called reactogenicity, from Moderna's vaccine. Some health experts agree.   
>  
>  
>  
>‚Äú**Somebody needs to address the elephant**: What about vaccine reactogenicity? While it's ‚Ä¶ not going to cause any long-term issues ‚Ä¶ how is that perception going to go with the public once they start receiving it?‚Äù asks Deborah Fuller, a vaccinologist at the University of Washington, Seattle, whose lab is developing second-generation RNA vaccines against COVID-19. She worries the side effects could feed vaccine hesitancy. ‚Äú**I feel like it's being glossed over**.‚Äù   
>  
>  
>  
>Most people will escape ‚Äúsevere‚Äù side effects, defined as those that prevent daily activity. Fewer than 2% of recipients of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines developed severe fevers of 39¬∞C to 40¬∞C. But if the companies win regulatory approvals, they're aiming to supply vaccine to 35 million people worldwide by the end of December. **If 2% experienced severe fever, that would be 700,000 people.**   
>  
>  
>  
>Hausman also sees a need to support people who have serious reactions. **For example, people may need ‚Äúa hotline with a nurse triaging ‚Ä¶** **figuring out if you need to go to the hospital or not. Will your medical expenses be covered if you do?** These are important questions.‚Äù 

&#x200B;

I'm not trying to contribute to fear mongering or indirectly help my NVAX investment by highlighting this (although these issues are part of what made me invest in NVAX in the first place). That's all from an article published in Science which would be one of the last sources that would ever be interested in reducing vaccine acceptance.

The bottom line is the US, vaccine skepticism and misinformation - particularly about COVID vaccines - is higher than ever. What's going to happen once the people being injected aren't clinical trial participants and instead include people that are reluctant/skeptical? Even if the rate of severe reactogenicity is only 1%, that's going to be a lot of sources for news stories ""about new untested mRNA vaccines"" and a lot people sharing horrible experiences on social media if millions get vaccinated. 

I think this could hit BNTX/MRNA hard if it becomes a big story line. Still probably some gains to be had in the runup to the EUA announcement, but I would be real careful if I was holding options once we get further into December and the probability of this as a story line increases.

&#x200B;

**NVAX + Positions update**

Assuming the below screenshot supposedly from JPM is [real](https://twitter.com/MaxSpeculation/status/1333956816187875328/photo/1) (I can't find the original source), NVAX lowered the interim update trigger from 66 events to 50 events in their Phase 3 UK trial, which means we'll get the interim update sooner that what was originally stated in the clinical trial protocol. Their head of R&D said they'd do this last week, so I suspect this is legit but no guarantees.

In case you're not familiar, the interim update is when we'll get the first readout on efficacy. If it's good (90-95%) then I think the stock goes up massively. So I'll be holding through that announcement pretty much no matter what happens from here on out. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qfzjp8efxp261.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=69fd7eab831c142ce03165be381c891ee54b00e8

&#x200B;

If you're holding options that expire on December 18th, then I might consider rolling them to January bc it will be cutting it close. My plan is to actively trade the December options and keep building my core position in January calls so I give myself enough breathing room for the announcement in case it doesn't come in December. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ojhduf3vtp261.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f7aed5054f1965cc9881274087cca2b06ec6782

I rolled a lot of gains from the last few days into these positions, so even though today I gave a lot back, I'm still up significantly since I started this trade. The reason for the weeklies is that NVAX has a couple of investor meetings coming up in the next two days and I think this rebounds.

&#x200B;

Good luck and hope this was helpful."

* If SPY holds current support, expect a bounce out of the falling wedge and look for a price target of 367.49+
* If spy breaks out of the rising wedge that bean forming on 11/30, expect it to fall between 364.20 - 363.23 - 361.52 depending on its exit point.

SPY jumped to .71% from the consolidation channel or .29% from the bottom price target.

[Here's an excerpt from two posts ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3cydq/spy_recap_nio_amd_and_tsla_ta_or_a_wsbs_wet_dream/):

>""Monday will be the start of SPY's 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes.

On the daily chart, if SPY can get to 366.29 - 372.50 and find support, the w-shaped recovery will be in play, and you could play a lotto380c and watch spy get to 381.90 - 398.03.

Based on his nonsensical comments, the market did a 180 degree turn-around as JMIA was down falling. this cannot be allowed. the much wiser WSB community must fight against this type of blatant market manipulation!

this is steve's thesis on the share offering: ""Offering when announced 10% dilutive but its growth capital so net accretive yet shares down 25%+. Doesn't make sense does it? Embrace opportunity. 1.2 billion population with only 2% online penetration""

First off, no fucking clue what he means by net 'accretive' so no it doesn't make sense, Steve...but sure a shit sounds like an attempt to convince the SEC that he's not manipulating the stock.

Second to the claims I understand:

\-**Steve's claim #2**: EMBRACE OPPORTUNITY

This is dumb, pollyannaish trash coming from someone who cannot come up with a good lie as to why he is manipulating the stock.

\-**Steve's claim #3:** 1.2 BILLION POPULATION WITH ONLY 2% ONLINE PENETRATION

This is a crazy lie to convince people that the market is less mature than it is and therefore we have to keep waiting for JMIA to figure out how not to throw cash into a fire pit.

[https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats1.htm](https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats1.htm) Internet penetration is 40% in Africa with 530M users. Africa has 212M Facebook users (40% of internet users). JMIA has 6.5M users or 1% of internet users measured as **annual active users.**..lol. AND... obviously what's more telling than pure numbers is that they've spent hundred of millions of dollars in marketing across 11 countries to get these dogshit numbers.

not to mention it's the only ecom stock on earth that reduced GMV during Covid. But wait...they're doing a 'product remix'...lol fucking cunts

anyway point being, we cannot let this brazen attempt at market manipulation stand, and this is the only platform for small retards like us to put some sense back into the market.

So, You see $BB all over the place and feel like FOMOing into calls. Here‚Äôs a better approach.

Instead, I‚Äôm going to sell a cash secure put or even sell it on margin (since the margin requirement are trivial, TD requires $75 margin!) at the $7.5 strike for the Jan 15th expiration. 

It was trading yesterday at $160, probably lower at market open today since BB is up 18%. Maybe even consider the $9 strike.

The reason being is that the IV is skyrocketing; currently at 130% and IV rank is at 60% meaning that this current level of IV is higher than 60% of the historical IV in the past year. 
Let‚Äôs see what the maximum gains and potential risks are:

If BB continues ripping, the put will expire worthless and i get to keep the credit and return about 200% on margin held.

If BB stays flat, the IV will crush ( known as reverting to the mean) will tank the premium of the puts which then i can buy back cheaper. 

If BB goes bankrupt and trades at $0 (unlikely but let‚Äôs assume maximum risk), max loss would be ($7.5-$0)*100= $750. 
But credit received is about $160 in credit, so $750-$160= $590. That‚Äôs the maximum loss in case BB goes to zero which isn‚Äôt gonna happen.

TLDR; instead of buying calls and paying for the insane IVs to subsequently get fucked by IV crush, sell a cash secured put."

But one interesting thing is just to highlight a section of this DD that actually fulfilled today as promised:

**4) TA - When the stars and crayons align. Here‚Äôs an excerpt from our resident astrologist** [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/)**:**

>Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80.While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from ‚Äì mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is \[redacted\][(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run. Compare \[redacted\] with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily ‚Äì figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (\~$15.80). The difference between \[redacted\] and $GME is that \[redacted\] was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME‚Äôs cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it‚Äôs African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don‚Äôt be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on. The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG). Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn‚Äôt just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day.This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn‚Äôt going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade. So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial ‚Äúline in the sand‚Äù for existing short positions.

Extreme TL;DR = Current cup and handle pattern of GME means if there is a bounce at $15.80, that means breakout is imminent.

And lo and behold, what do we see? The markets ended at $15.80 on the dot, and the afterhours pricing is already back up to $15.92, as foretold by [u/JayAreW](https://www.reddit.com/u/JayAreW/).

What will happen when there is a breakout? Apparently through TA our resident prophet figured out the breakeven point for short sellers is $15.80, and if GME passes the test at the $15.80 support level and begins to climb again, short sellers are gonna start panicking and start buying back share en masse, which will drive the short squeeze. Ooorrrrrr, they can short even MORE to try and squash the price down, but come earnings report on Dec 8th, if either the report was better than expected, or if Cohen, the dude who built a billion dollar fucking dog food company, does a hostile take over for GME due to less than stellar reports, again, that's a catalyst for the stocks to go up, leading again to short sellers getting fucked if they don't start buying back shares.  


If we autistic fucks can see this and figure this out, then FOR SURE the institutions and investment firms who shorted GME can see this and figure this out too. So their move is to keep shorting and not break the line as a whole and hope that we bow out and panic sell. And what are we waitinf for? We're waiting for the firms to panic, break rank, and start to buy up shares to cover their puts. So literally this situation is like two armies staring at each other, each waiting for the other to break their line first and turn tail and run. IT'S A FUCKING WESTERN SHOW DOWN. 

That is why, for all you paper hand mofos, literally stop it. Stop it. Stop selling and HOLD FOR AT LEAST A MONTH YOU PANSY BITCHES! Don't you realize the investment firms are scared, fund managers are gonna get fired if the short squeeze happens, so they're doing everything in their power to keep prices down by shorting, wanting cause fear among average joe retail investors like us? This is the wealth transfer from the 1% back to the common people we've been waiting for! If ONLY y'all don't bitch out and stand the line strong! Just be patient and if calls are too risky, just fuking buy shares then! Then you can factor out the risk of time and just enjoy the tendies at the end of the month!

Lastly, just like what Citron did to PLTR, plain old market manipulation by publishing a bogus report and price target on PLTR and taking money from all the paper hand bitches here, I'd expect desperate boomer firms to try some equal bullshit in scaring you all to selling. Just expect it to come and HOLD DAMN IT. This is the short squeeze opportunity of a lifetime, and you get to be part of history, and one day you'll be able to tell your grandkids how you fucked up, missed the $500 peak cuz you got too greedy, and sold it at $60 instead.

TL;DR = GME, Tendies, Moon.

Like for me at least, its obvious to be investing in airlines right now as they're low currently and the world will eventually return to normal and even if that's not soon, they are guaranteed bailouts etc. But I feel like that's obvious because of the really weird situation we're in. 

My question: is 2020 and during the pandemic a very different kind of stock market? When the pandemic ends, does trading become more nuanced? Or is actually just because i wasn't in it before, that I didn't notice the more 'obvious' moves.

When someone tells you to buy a stock without a large DD to help their argument **do not buy.**

 **The 25% sell-off in Nikola on Monday represents a good buying  opportunity for investors as the company is no longer distracted by its  Badger pickup truck, JPMorgan said.** 

 **""We think this is a positive outcome for NKLA over the medium to  longer term, since the company can now focus on the core Class 8 truck  initiative,"" JPMorgan said.** 

**NIKOLA TRE**

**Financial Times and Wall Street Journal** both confirmed the rumor that Nikola signed a contract with Romeo Power to use their batteries in the Tre 

The Tre is the only way they have to get something on the road. They have NO working technology. They don't have a proper chassis, so the Tre uses an Iveco chassis. They have no battery so they are stuck white labeling Romeo modules in a horrendous pack design. 

 So, a little background on battery design. When you are designing a battery you have two separate things that you have to account for: capacity, which gives you range, and voltage, which allows you to provide necessary power. You get both of these by connecting together cells. 

 There are two different ways you can connect cells: In parallel, which increases capacity while keeping voltage unchanged, or in series which increases capacity AND voltage. An automotive scale battery will have cells connected in parallel and then those groups in series. 

 The problem comes when, like Nikola, you are stuck using off the shelf modules: For these, the cell groups are already set for you and you are stuck with them. If it isn't what you need for your battery design, you're stuck. This is why custom battery design is crucial. 

 In the case of Nikola, the Hermes modules they are using from Romeo Power have a capacity of 10 kWh and have a voltage of about 100 V when topped off.  To power their truck, they need 800V, so that's 8 modules connected in series. 

 But this sets the capacity for them: 8 modules of 10 kWh each comes out to 80 kWh. While that is a great number for the passenger vehicles that Romeo presumably designed these modules for, it isn't nearly enough for a semi truck. The Tre needs 720 kWh 

So they need 72 Hermes modules. But they can't just put them in series or the voltage will be 7200 Volts, far too much to be safe in an EV. So it is impossible to properly design a battery pack using these modules, and Nikola was forced to improperly design one. 

**NIKOLA TWO**

It has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt. Video shows it creeping along at 10 or 15 mph 

Nikola Two For those who don't know, that's the two trucks that they had Bosch design and build for them a couple of years ago. 

He claimed that it could do 0-60 in under five seconds, when anyone could see it took at least 10 seconds. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSiWPNe2llU&feature=emb_logo)

1. The range extender power was dramatically reduced. 

2. The battery was made smaller, which not only decreases electric range but also available power.  

3. Nikola most likely replaced the power cells of the One with energy cells in the Two.  

4. They replaced the two speed transmission with a single speed.  

Two speed gearboxes are hard, so Nikola just dropped it. Now, you would be able to make up for the loss of the second gear by just cranking up the power (this is Tesla's approach) but instead Nikola REDUCED the power. The result is this hapless machine that can't go on the road. 

Nikola spent two or three precious years making an utterly failed design that they can't do anything with except creep around the parking lot with guests while they shout above the howl of the radiator fans.  

The truck is worthless. Completely road unworthy, by their own admission. It has only been on the road once, when they delivered a nearly empty load of beer a couple of miles for a publicity stunt. Video shows it creeping along at 10 or 15 mph. No wonder it's parking lot only. 

There is ONE time we did see the Two driving kind of fast. It's in a video called, predictably, ""Nikola Two in Motion"". The video description is almost a word for word copy of that of the famous video of the One rolling down the hill. 

**TLDR:  Nio was trading at 7 dollars with actually technology and vehicle sales earlier this year, so nikola should be valued at penny stock status.  just my opinion due to risks of being** ***delisted due to defrauding investors.***

518,FREE MONEY ALERT: Salesforce ($CRM) 12/31 250C,111,k50ckv,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k50ckv/free_money_alert_salesforce_crm_1231_250c/,122,"Note: Buying my positions at open in the morning cause I‚Äôm not retarted 

I‚Äôm going to start giving you all free money alerts. 

Called BABA at 255 a few weeks back, and PLUG at the end of October. I know the sub-species of idiots who exist on this sub need to earn some money to later lose on OTM calls for high-risk small cap companies that are at all time highs. I‚Äôm here to provide. 

There is no better purchase then Saleforce tomorrow, we are below all moving short &amp; long averages, and we of course have had another unprecedented crash on amazing news. Providing a wonderful opportunity for you idiots to buy in at an absolute low, when the company will be at all time highs within the next two months. 

I know some dumb cunts are going to be like ‚Äúwell their future outlook isn‚Äôt looking as good as we wanted‚Äù I‚Äôm here to tell you that when stocks have been crashing like Paul Walker after beating expectations for no reason, what do you do as a CEO and CFO to attempt to avoid this? You set the bar super fucking LOW to make sure your investors are nothing but happy and stop reducing your companies value by 10% every quarter. It‚Äôs like none of you have ever read a book on financial relations or PR.. Oh wait... 

Buy the stock or by calls, whatever you want to do, Saleforce will absolutely make you money this month. Merry Christmas assholes.

EDIT: Well boys and girls if you got in early this morning; Christmas came fucking early.

EDIT 2: Position adjustment: Day traded 12/31 250C for roughly 50% gain. Due to larger sell off then anticipated adjusted the Strike to 12/31 240C. 

There also seems to be a misconception about what I expect to gain from these contracts, and I need to make sure that everyone understands I do not chase 4000% gains. I‚Äôm not betting on CRM going to 300 by the end of December. 

When it comes to making money with bullish OTM positions the question is simple: Will the stock price rise enough, and at a high enough ROC (Average ROC presented with IV) to overcome the loss of speculative value, or Theta from its current position? When I release free money alerts I‚Äôm telling you that within the expiration date this will occur. Whether you want to hold and hope that it continues is fully up to you. In other words I‚Äôm happy to tell you what to buy, but I won‚Äôt tell you when to take profit. 

In other words people, don‚Äôt get greedy and bag-hold your fucking calls over the next month if you have OTM‚Äôs. Take advantage of the oversell on the bounce back and get out. You don‚Äôt buy OTM hoping for real value by the time they expire you buy them to sell on the one big day it bounces back."

524,$YY = TikTok + OnlyFans,3,k5lh84,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5lh84/yy_tiktok_onlyfans/,30,"Greetings fellow autists. Y'all remember Marie Kondo? Japanese woman that gets off to cleaning people's shit up for them? Only keep things that spark joy? Fuck yeah. Well, with all you retards losing money by being balls long PLTR, I figured it was time to help you Marie Kondo your own portfolio. Let's tidy that shit up and spark some fucking Joyy.

Yes I spelled Joyy with two y's. And no big brain, that wasn't a typo. **Joyy ($YY) is your next one-way ticket to the goddamn moon.** Can you do basic math? Great. Neither can I. Do you get slightly aroused at the mere sight of a woman with a pulse? Of course you do. I myself just went six to midnight typing that out. Do you like losing money in the stonk market? Clearly. But I'm here to try to change that.

Congrats on making it this far. Let's get started!

$YY is the largest live-streaming platform you've never heard of. **It's like if TikTok merged with OnlyFans and was a publicly traded stonk**. I'll wait while you buy a few shares on that premise alone.

But it gets better. Much better. Joyy operates two live-streaming services, one is called YY Live and its getting sold to Baidu for $3.6bn. **The other is called Bigo Live and it's one of the top 10 apps in the world with revenues growing more than 130% y/y.** Many of the videos on Bigo are of hot Asian women live-streaming themselves dancing. Nice.

That's still not even the best part though. Galaxy brain question: would you rather pay full price for something or get something at a discount? What if you could get it for close to free? Well, at YY's current price, you're nearly getting Bigo Live for free. Please consult a doctor if you have an erection lasting for more than four hours.

How can that be? This part requires some remedial math skills that you and I both don't have, but alas, we must soldier on.

YY currently has $2.8bn in net cash on their balance sheet. Woah! I didn't know this was a fucking advanced accounting class. Well it is. Stay with me. We also know YY is going to get $3.6bn in cash from Baidu for the sale of YY Live. Lastly, YY is an investor in a company called HUYA that is valued at $750mm.

So... $2.8bn plus $3.6bn plus $750mm is? No, not $420.69 you retard. Try again. It's $7.1bn. Feel free to sit down and drink a sip of water if your head is spinning from all these numbers.

Compare this $7.1bn to YY's current market cap of $7.8bn. $7.8bn minus $7.1bn for everything that isn't Bigo Live is $600mm. There you have it. That's the implied value the market is giving to Bigo Live.

Holy shit right? To quote the great David Byrne from Talking Heads: [you may ask yourself](https://youtu.be/5IsSpAOD6K8?t=69)...

* Didn't Baidu just pay $3.6bn for YY Live?
* And isn't Bigo Live growing 130%+ while YY Live is barely growing?
* And aren't Bigo Live and YY Live about the same size at $1.8bn in revenues?
* And finally ‚Äì you may ask yourself ‚Äì if Baidu is willing to pay $3.6bn for YY Live, shouldn't Bigo Live be valued way the fuck more than that?

**The answer to all of these questions is fuck yes.** Bigo Live should be valued way higher than $600mm but you retards are too busy jacking off and losing money on PLTR to figure it out.

**The other great part about YY is we get to fuck some bears on our way to the moon**. I cannot expressly condone nor condemn the actual fucking of bears, but I can condone the fucking of some short sellers. Muddy Waters just released a short report on Joyy and short sellers piled in like the dumbass lemmings they are. How did YY respond to the short report you may ask? **By giving MW the double middle finger and increasing their dividend by $200mm.** Do frauds usually do that? Hell no they don't.

That's how you fucking spark Joyy in your portfolio!"

Oh yeah, house votes on legalizing Cannabis today which should pass.  May get killed in the Senate unless the dems win the GA Senate runoffs in January which is a possibility especially with the Trump supporters wanting to boycott the GA runoff elections as they feel disenfranchised with Trump's loss in GA.  

On top of which, Mexico's senate voted to legalize weed last week and they need to make a decision by 12/15 so there's another vote in the lower chamber this week or next to make it happen.

And Thailand recently legalized it (like last week!)  Why is that big?  Because ASIA is huge!  Where do you think we shipped all of our cigarettes after it became unfashionable here in the states?  Those guys literally wrote the book on sin and excess.  Why do you think so many dorky white men fly to thailand?  For the massaman curry?

And, ""The United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) on Wednesday accepted a World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to remove cannabis and cannabis resin from Schedule IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.""

It's already totally legal in 15 states, medicinally legal in 20 more, and decriminalized in 10 more beyond that.  https://disa.com/map-of-marijuana-legality-by-state


TLDR; lots of catalysts happening on the weed front.  it will legalize eventually.  make your bets.  2021 will be a banner year for weed."

541,CRM BUYS SLACK | NIKOLA STOCK CRASH | PFIZER APPROVED IN UK| STOCK MARKET NEWS [12-02],13,k584cp,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k584cp/crm_buys_slack_nikola_stock_crash_pfizer_approved/,13,"**SALESFORCE CRUSHES EARNINGS AND ACQUIRES SLACK, NIKOLA STOCK CONTINUES TO TUMBLE AS WE FINALLY GET THE FIRST VACCINE APPROVAL IN THE UK, LET‚ÄôS DISCUSS THIS AND MORE ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET**

Hey everyone! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/PzNKCYh) leading the way up almost 1,3%, finishing at a new record high, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/syB7wP4) also up over 1,1% and finishing at a new record high, while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/HggpWGF) had smaller gains but was still up to intraday records before finishing over +0,6% for the day. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SDCq7vf) rose for the day after opening at 20,2 and as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/0n1TDKt) big gains were led by the FAANG stocks with Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix gaining over 2% for the day while Amazon and Microsoft also were up at least 1%. This pulled the big indexes higher as they account for a big part of them.

Over 60% of companies were advancing on average volume while companies moving above important moving averages continued to climb as we are going into a very risky market, as to many companies are trading high at the moment and are due for a correction. [CHART](https://ibb.co/DfgJ12R)

The biggest gaining [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/T8NPW6W) yesterday were Communications, Financials and Technology with most sectors being in the green, except industrial, as the laggards from yesterday were small cap growth companies and especially those from CHINA, like NIO, Alibaba and others, that have suffered from the recent news that the US is looking to delist some of them if they do not meet new standards. [CHART](https://ibb.co/gmpRVWW)

Here are the most interesting economic events and data for [TODAY](https://ibb.co/cyp7x5W), as we will see how Mortgage Applications and ADP Jobs are going. Afterwards a couple of FED leaders will speak before we can take a look at how the Petroleum Inventories are going.

While [GREAT NEWS](https://ibb.co/1d6y1yh) started to pop in the early morning as the UK has become the first country to authorize the Pfizer vaccine for use.

This news are already baked in the market in my opinion as investors were already expecting this to happen sooner rather than later, but this are still very good news to hear, as a confirmation is still great to have, rather than just expectations. I expect the US will soon follow in the next 10-14 days to approve both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, that might just have a bigger impact on the stock market, but I would be careful until then, as we might get a correction in the stock market after this huge rally before we can move on even higher, as I fully expect this bull market to continue into 2021 and 2022.

Well yesterday, as I expected Nikola [tumbled again](https://ibb.co/2hzPCJL) after the insider lockup period expired, as only the possibility of Milton selling his shares has spooked the market after an already bad day with the GM deal disappointing investors. As the original deal is null and void with GM not taking any stake in Nikola or helping with the engineering or manufacturing of the Badger pickup truck. The only good thing in sight for the company is the possible hydrogen fueling station network partnership by year end as announced by the management. I maintain my sell opinion on this stock as I predicted a 15-16$ in the future when the stock was trading over 20, I think it has more room to go down, it might go to single digits in the long run, as the company has become very shady after the fiasco with the misleading tactics and no breaking new fuel cell technology.

On the other hand, Salesforce crushed [earnings](https://ibb.co/XCzz5Mz) expectations, as they beat the EPS by almost 1$ and had a revenue beat of over 160 million$. They also raised [guidance](https://ibb.co/JRf2G3j) for both revenue and EPS for next year way above the consensus while also maintaining cash and equivalents at over $9B, up 45% for the year.

The company also officially [announced](https://ibb.co/whYVfzC) the acquiring of Slack in a deal worth almost $28B. This will result in the Slack software being incorporated in every aspect of Salesforce cloud offering. This 2 will be the biggest competitors yet for Microsoft. So, I believe after the dust settles, and CRM stock finally gets back on track, we will have a good long term growth opportunity with Salesforce.

Slack also reported earnings yesterday after the bell as the company [posted](https://ibb.co/N6Qnw7M) a beat of estimates and an increase in paid customers and billings.

We also got some [numbers](https://ibb.co/6rNGCnZ) from Cyber Monday sales as the spending increase over 15% but, this was not enough to meet all the estimates as holiday shopping has been probably spread through the whole month of November and will continue to go strong in December in my opinion.

While on the economic front news were not so great as the [November ISM](https://ibb.co/3yM4Hwc) index fell shy of expectations with light vehicles [sales](https://ibb.co/PG09TRf) dropping by almost 1 million from last month and are way below the year ago period.

But we did see some big improvements in [construction spending](https://ibb.co/cc5z2wq), as the numbers came in about half a % better than consensus and are up 3,7% year over year while the [November PMI](https://ibb.co/6JzRnJ1) index saw the biggest improvement in over 6 years.

The biggest earnings that will be released today will be from [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/RvSk8SJ) and [Okta](https://ibb.co/RDrYy8K), as I expect both of them to turn out a positive EPS, as we might see some momentum in this stocks if they don‚Äôt disappoint.

I greatly expect the [IPO](https://ibb.co/pKzxhmK) of AirBNB, as this could become a company that will benefit a lot from the reopening of the world in the next year or two.

The founders have now twice said, they dont want to go public. Ackman too had said Stripe is not ready to go public.

Ackman also said, likely announcement of target will be in first quarter next year.

So with this info, I am quite sure PSTH will go down to $23 - $24 range in next few days.

My retarded suggestion is as follows:

If you have commons, sell covered calls for Dec / Jan, wheel it.
If you have dec calls, sell it
If you have jan calls, cover it with dec calls or sell it.
If you have march calls, cover it with jan calls.

Again, this is just an opinion from your retarded bro and I thought many times if I should make this post or not, but eventually decided to make one.

There's a vote tomorrow that a lot of retail investors are panicking about because ""AlL ChyNeSe StocKs aRe GeTTinG deListEd"". Bro. Look at this shitty spreadsheet I made, the panic today was in the EV sector, not Chinese stonks. Look at fucking $BABA and $JD chilling, huge market cap companies not panicking on a vote tomorrow,  know why? Because there's no fucking chance in hell they get de-listed.

Even if this vote passes, the companies get THREE YEARS to comply with the US about their stock exchanges being audited by US companies. Before you say NIO is audited by an American company, no it's not, it's a Chinese branch of that company and the US wants their own hooligans in there, which by law in China is not allowed because Chyna #1

Here's why you shouldn't panic:

Look at fucking Baillie Gifford and Company who own 8.91% of NIO who KNEW about the bill proceeding to the house from passing the senate in MAY 2020. They increased their ownership by over  ELEVEN MILLION SHARES, don't know how much money that is my smooth brained companion? That's over a $495M bet on NIO going upsies.

Now what do I think will happen? The bill is probably going to pass and shit pissy retail investors are going to continue to panic sell, it's a buying opportunity IMO.

Hey everyone and Welcome! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/2g68hFq) finish about flat for the day, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/cr8CXVz) finished about half a percent down for the day and the [DOW INDUSTRIAL](https://ibb.co/9tFCX3j) was the biggest losers down almost 1% thought all 3 of them were down even bigger intraday. So, both the SP and the DOW finished with record monthly gains, the SP finish up 10,9% for the month above the previous record of 10,2% exactly 40 years ago, while the DOW finished up 11,9% and topped the previous record from 1987 with the Nasdaq also having its best month since the middle of the dot-com boom in 2001. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/4g07SHm) also finished down more than 1% for the day though at one point it almost hit the 23 mark.

Almost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)

Energy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.

Here are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company‚Äôs future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)

Great news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it‚Äôs GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.

Also, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it‚Äôs shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.

Also relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.

While the hydrogen power Nikola seen it‚Äôs share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock‚Ä¶ So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.

Good news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.

Other great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe‚Äôs, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.

While on the vaccine front, Moderna‚Äôs candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it‚Äôs head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they‚Äôre first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.

The only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.

Meanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn‚Äôt gone to far to the left.

So I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.

Vale has been on a bull run with the rest of the market, the sentiment is that Vale is working out a deal with TSLA over supplying nickel for the car batteries that elon musk is going to be producing; I got to thinking exactly how much will vale be getting in revenue and wanted to crack down on some numbers with some assumptions added in, If tesla is set to manufacture 500,000 cars this year and each battery cost on average 10-12k, we can assume that half if not less is for the materials of producing the batteries and then the rest is either markup or for labor; So taking some rough numbers, 5k$ x 500,000 cars is 2.5 Billion USD for the year.. Good chunk of change! but is it enough to push vale to new highs?

Vale currently trades around $15.50 a share, and looks like it will push around 75 billion in revenue, currently at a market cap of 82 Billion dollars and a net income looking around 20 billion for the year after 4th quarter reports later.

TSLA will definitely add some value, but what valuation would be reasonable to aim for? 100 billion market cap? 120 billion market cap? or perhaps is an 80 billion market cap a fair price as of right now and in the near future.

&#x200B;

I am bullish on this stock, I think that as TSLA grows and the EV market grows, so will opportunity for nickel/iron miners.. But I see road bumps in the near future and would like to get some thoughts on this.

When buying a call (or a put), you're effectively buying the right to purchase a stock at a set price.  
With a call, you are paying someone for the right to buy their shares at a specific price. This is called the **Strike price**. Your contract also has an expiry date. If the stock is below the strike price on/before the expiry, your option expires worthless, and your maximum loss is the amount of money you paid for the contract.  
If the stock is above the strike price on/before the expiry, you can either sell the contract, or hold onto it with the hope of it continueing to go up. At expiry, if the contract is ""in the money"" (profitable), then you have the right to exercise this contract and buy the shares for the strike price.

  
Your call option has several things incorporated in it for the price you pay.

1) you have the time value. How long is left between the day you buy vs the day it expires.

2) Implied volatility of the stock between the day you buy and the day it expires (how much the expected move in the stock is between now and the expiry date)

3) the difference in price between the option's strike and the stock's price

4) The supply/demand factor.

&#x200B;

Let's use real-life examples:  
You buy 100 shares of GME. You're paying  **16.19** per share as of right now. That means you need to invest 1619$ today to have ownership of these shares.

Your maximum downside is 1619$, your upside is unlimited.

If shares drop back down to 5$, you lose 1,119$ \[ (16.19 - 5) x 100 \]  
If shares run to 30$, you make 1,381$ \[ (30 - 16.19) x 100 \]

December 31 2020 16$ call options currently have a bid of 3.15$ and an ask of 3.40$.  
Which means, if you buy at market price, you're paying 3.40$ per share for the right to buy shares between now and december 31st at 16$.  
Assuming you hold until that day, your break-even price is 19.40$.  
However, you only pay 3.40\*100 = 340$ for this right.

If the stock drops back to 5$, your maximum loss is 340$ in this scenario.  
Your upside however, is unlimited.  
If shares run up to 30$ on december 10th, you still have some time value to the options, plus you have some implied volatility, plus you have the movement.  
So, your 16$ calls will probably sell for slightly more than 14$ (30-16).  
At expiry, you'll have the option to either a) sell those options or b) have them exercise, allowing you to buy the shares for 16$.  


The leverage effect comes in the fact that you only paid 340$ for this contract and in the fact that you get the upside of those 100 shares without as large of a cash outlay.  


If you're right on the direction and the timing of your bet, you can make a lot of money.

If you're wrong, this acts as a way to minimize your losses.

If I‚Äôve learned anything after losing 5k since February, it‚Äôs that you don‚Äôt lose until you sell. 90% of the trades that I fumbled, due to being a paper-handed retard, mooned soon thereafter. 

If you didn‚Äôt notice in the past couple of weeks prior to this slow ‚Äúsell off‚Äù of GME, PLTR, and a handful of others these last few days, there was a large amount of bullish sentiment surrounding these stonks and you more than likely got AT LEAST 1-2 nice trades off before this ball draining decline (if you didn‚Äôt FOMO entirely too late). A large number of the bearish posts were being downvoted to oblivion or deleted by shit mods. Weird right. (Insert bull trap) 

Now, if you look at the recent posts regarding these same stonk handles, there‚Äôs a growing number of bearish fucktards saying things like ‚ÄúPLTR $10 EOY‚Äù & ‚ÄúGME going back to $5‚Äù. ü§° The shorts are getting theirs during this time and are taking what they came for before the inevitable occurs with all of these (our testicles dragging across the moon, Mars, your mom‚Äôs chin, what have you üöÄüöÄüöÄ). This is our time to shine. You heard it hear first. (Insert bear trap)

TL;DR - Don‚Äôt go against your senses and go all gay bear on us ... we‚Äôre holding strong and retail is about to overtake institutional. Don‚Äôt go too short on your calls but be sure to lock in these free tendies. üìà

GME $25+ EOY.

Executive Summary: Market has wrongly placed PTON into a COVID basket of stocks which would see demand and growth disappear once a vaccine is developed and life goes ""back to normal"".  Bears believe demand will disappear, everyone will cancel their accounts and the bikes will end up on eBay.  They are wrong. Below are the reasons why the bears have it wrong.

&#x200B;

* PTON revenue 2017 - 2020 and 2021(company projection):  Y/Y 100% gains.  Starting well before COVID.  Working out at home was already a trend.  Think of all the Instagrammers who were starting their own workout pages and charging membership for basic production value instruction. Enter PTON a professional plan and revenue starts growing.  When COVID comes it accelerated the demand and PTON is now about 4 years ahead of their own projections and accelerating.
   * 2017 $218M
   * 2018 $435M  +100%
   * 2019 $915M  +110%
   * 2020 $1,826M +100%
   * 2021 (est.) $4,000M+  +119%
* Massive Lead in interconnected fitness space. No significant competitor into this new space.
* Premium Product and experience.  Works as expected.  Intuitive. Addictive. Measured performance. Results.
* Cult like enthusiasm amount users.
* Demand outpacing supply - Building additional capacity to address this very real issue.  Wait times for delivery can exceed months.
* Celebrity exclusive artists. Exclusive access to superstars.
* Growing class usage - artist classes with over 300,000 riders.  massive social movement.  Think of over 4 average football stadiums combined.  Each day classes get bigger. Costs stay same.
* Social power of audience size.  Large Data opportunity. Potential marketing opportunity.
* Subscriber base is growing and still small given the TAM.   Q1 ending Connected Fitness Subscriptions grew 137% to over 1.33 million and paid Digital Subscriptions grew 382% to over 510,000; total Members grew to over 3.6 million.
* Used by celebrates, athletes, trainers, and everyday people.
* Patented experience. 8 separate patents on the bike, 5 on the treadmill.
* Increasing manufacturing capabilities and building out flagship spaces in major cities. Branding very strong.
* Profitable in last 2 quarters - expected to have 4th quarter of profit at 3/31/2021.
* Consideration for S&P 500 inclusion in 2021.
* Price: $40 per month is a bargain compared to in person cycle classes that can be $20-$40 per single class depending on the market.  The membership is good for two people.  With more equipment in the future the membership becomes even more efficient.  Bike costs are fixed and financeable.
* Work from Home thesis.  I see working from home as a new normal.  Those that have jobs where it is possible to work from home have adjusted and found ways to perform remotely. They have gained time with their own family and found time that was otherwise wasted in a commute.  Working from home is very efficient and green.  Companies will adjust.  Commercial real estate is hollowing out at an incredible rate.
* Investment commitment.  When someone pays $2,000 for a product they are invested.  I see this as another sticky point.
* People get used to their favorite trainers.  They follow them online and connect with them.
* Tags are used for community.
* Ride with friends.
* Multiple products.  Aside from Bike, there is stretch, strength, core, outside running, treadmill running, yoga, Pilates, meditation, etc.  This is not a one trick pony and the more a user is engaged the more valuable the subscription becomes.
* Additional Markets - PTON has not entered the eastern markets.  They have barely started to enter the US market.
* New products.  Bike and Bike+.  New treadmill to be released soon.
* Apparel Line
* Healthcare case.  Health is more important than ever.  Potential partnerships with medical providers that could subsidize membership and product as part of premium.
* Intersection of existing business models.  AAPL - Product.  FB - Social Community. NFLX - Subscription.
* Average analyst price target remains around $135. Top target is $160.

TL/DR.  Lots of ways for PTON to win. Fears of demand disappearing after a vaccine are unfounded.

I have witnessed EXPE, ROOM, HLF and Volkswagen shorts, but never seen anything like this. How do you even short anymore than the float ? do you just make up shares which is illegal under the guidelines and trading rules.  

Then how do you get 65.16 million shares outstanding and 67.45 million shares short. Even if the float wasn't enough they shorted 2.29 million shares over every share ever issued in this company. How is it even possible? The answer is it isn't and it's illegal

-Elon Musk

Oh Elon, sorry to steal your thunder. But GME will make TSLA vol look like TLT. Jeff haunting your every accomplishment yet again.

-----

I‚Äôm back with the final warning bell. The next time I post in 2021 will be to recap the squeeze‚Äôs results and post gain porn along with u/Deep_Fucking_Value, u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT, u/Tomatotowers, and more. *This is the last stop before the moon mission.*

It‚Äôs currently not too late. But after Q3 earnings on Dec 8th, it will be.

Here‚Äôs a comprehensive GME overview for all new and returning WSB-monkeys. Sit down and grab some tea. This is a long one unlike the previous posts.

**GME Overview:**

The GME story can be broken up into 2 main theses. The first is a deep value play which has credibility all on its own. The second is an infinity short squeeze like we‚Äôve never seen before in history, which has credibility all on its own. When combining the two, you get the trade of a lifetime. 

In all my (albeit limited) days, I have never EVER seen a trade set up like this before. I‚Äôve pored over every source of historical finance material I can get my hands on, and still have nothing to reference to. IMO, this will look more like the 2008-MBS bet, or the Ackman 2020-COVID ‚ÄúHell is coming‚Äù bet, than TSLA, OSTK, KBIO, or VW.

Just a fucking face-ripping, out-of-nowhere, legendary-HOF-ticker bet that will bankrupt some funds and get people fired - and of course, with no community other than WSB‚Äôs name next to it in the history books (and if I could pencil in our lovely GME discord hosted by u/BadElf21 and u/RoaringKitty‚Äôs YT stream).

Let‚Äôs begin.

**Act 1 - The Set Up:**

Q: Why is GME so heavily shorted in the first place? Why are we betting the long? Aren‚Äôt they going bankrupt ala Blockbuster? If not, are we just trading this short term like a HTZ/CCL meme stonk?

A: NO. This is a fundamentally solid deep value play at its core.

First let‚Äôs go back a few years. We must give the shorts due credit in order to understand where we are now. GME has been profitably shorted since 2013 when the market correctly bet on the digitization of video games and spread of mobile gaming. Some data here:

* GME sales have plunged from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019.

* GME Annual EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to only $111 million in fiscal year 2019.

* Net income has fallen off a cliff from $339 million in fiscal year 2011 to a staggering loss of $470 million in fiscal year 2019.

* In the two most recent quarters alone, GME lost another $277 million.

The shorts are betting on $0. 

However, in the last 12 months, GME has shown that their terminal velocity does not lead to bankruptcy. GME has a strong balance sheet. [Cash on hand is worth over $12 a share. Net cash is worth over $5 a share](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment) and is FCF positive (nixing the bankruptcy thesis). They also paid off $125M in debt last month just to show Moody‚Äôs they are healthy due to their incoming console cycle FCF (which may lead to possible bond upgrade, enticing more institutional investors).

So give the shorts credit. They had a legitimate case until the last 12 months, when George Sherman (CEO), Reggie Fils-Aime (ex-Nintendo, current GME board member), and others have been conducting a phenomenally well executed turnaround.

That explains why we currently have ~70M shares short out of ~65M shares outstanding - but they‚Äôre all now caught on the wrong side of the trade.

In case the severity of the short interest hasn‚Äôt hit you yet, **there is a bigger market for shorting GME than the business of GME itself.** This is not even taking into account the long holders ([Senvest, Ryan Cohen, Burry, Donald Foss, Sherman, Hestia/Permit](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)) which takes ~25M shares out of circulation. So short interest in reality could be around 180%+ of true float. 

A true head-scratcher. 

And a worthy opponent.

But they‚Äôre wrong.

**Act 2 - Avengers, Assemble:**

Q: Why am I so sure GME is prime to blow? Isn‚Äôt this just another meme stonk hunch driven by WSB and Michael Burry hype? How can a few online gamblers and a few activist investors turn a dying business into a trade of a lifetime? 

Couldn‚Äôt the shorts be right? Also, hasn‚Äôt it blown already?

A: NO AGAIN.

Let me show you the ridiculous Avengers team we have. By Avengers team, I mean all the bullish cases:

**1) Ryan Cohen**

Iron Man of the bunch, some call him the Dog-Man.

This guy is a crazy entrepreneur. He took on Bezos with a pet food company (CHWY) and won. Let me repeat - he beat Jeff Amazon without AWS subsidizing his loss leaders.

In other words, he built Markk I (CHWY) in a tiny cave with scraps all by himself with his dad, and now that he has billions, he wants to build nanotech Markk 50 (GME). Read up on this guy. He‚Äôs as crazy and as smart as they come.

He also wrote a scathing [letter](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf) to GME leadership, but if you read between the lines, he‚Äôs not addressing the existing board, who had only been there temporarily. He‚Äôs setting this letter up in order to potentially offer a takeover bid (rumor mill - unconfirmed). 

Either way, GME leadership needs to address this letter in the Q3 earnings call on Dec 8th - which means they need to either post a good quarter, provide good guidance, or add color to existing developments.

Otherwise George Sherman (Cpt America)‚Äôs ass is out the door and Cohen takes over as the leader of the Avengers through a vote or buyout. Either of which requires shares to be recalled.

One more thing to note about RC. There has been no 13D/A filling since his initial purchases. Which means he is STILL IN. He has not sold a single share. 


**2) GME Leadership and activist investors - Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Very Strange Burry, and the old Captain trying to fit in with the youngsters:**


Dr. Very Strange Burry - AKA Big Short Man. Supreme numbers aspie who might have a screw loose but is unmatched at spotting contrarian trades. *Edit 2: BTW for those asking about his holdings drop. He's trimming to stay under 5%, but still has a large position: 

- Q1: 3,000,000 shares worth $10,500,000

- Q2: 2,750,000 shares worth $11,935,000

- Q3: 1,703,400 shares worth $17,375,000


Hestia/Permit/Senvest - Contrarian, activist investors.


Cpt George Sherman - Boomer CEO who knows what he‚Äôs doing.


Reggie Fils-Aime - Beloved ex-Nintendo President.


**3) Bond repurchase**
	
GME just bought back [$125M](http://news.gamestop.com/node/18286/html) of debt maturing in 2021. Who cares? Yes - normally this is a nothing burger even for a micro-cap, but if the shorts are betting on $0 - this is clear evidence against that bet.

Secondly, rumor mill has it that this debt repurchase plus positive Q3 earnings/guidance will allow Moody‚Äôs to upgrade their 2023 debt to A or maybe higher.

This is HUGE because it allows institutional investors to long GME without further restrictions. In other words, they may not be allowed to long companies with B- debt. Once this is upgraded, more buyers are allowed to come in.

Very underplayed story here.


**4) TA - When the stars and crayons align. Here‚Äôs an excerpt from our resident astrologist u/JayAreW:**

> Ignoring the short squeeze element of GME and just looking at chart action, there are two elements that are important to keep track of. The cup and handle pattern and $15.80. 

> While my trading style is 90% technical analysis, there are certain elements which I shy away from ‚Äì mainly chart patterns. However, it is important to at least recognize the obvious ones because if you see it, chances are others see it too. The main pattern I keep an eye out for are the massive cup and handle patterns. This is an example from Pring [figure 1](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103438112030760/cup_and_handle_pring_fig_1.PNG).

> The buy signal is traditionally a breakout above the handle, and a good estimate for price target is the distance from the base of the cup to the handle, added to the breakout point. A recent example of this is $JMIA [(daily - figure 2)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103467937988628/jmia_cup_and_handle_fig_2.PNG). Notice not one, but two failures to break the top of the handle and the subsequent parabolic run.
Compare $JMIA with $GME and you see almost the same pattern [(daily ‚Äì figure 3)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103497926082580/gme_cup_and_handle.PNG). The traditional buy signal would be a breach above the red line (~$15.80). The difference between $JMIA and $GME is that $JMIA was far more condensed; the pattern played out over a period of a few months where $GME‚Äôs cup and handle started in late 2019. Playing this pattern exclusively, I would expect a price target of roughly $27, stretched out over a period of weeks/months and not as explosive as it‚Äôs African counterpart (assuming a squeeze doesn't happen between now and then). Typically, any chart pattern calls for a retest of the breakout point, so don‚Äôt be surprised if $GME retraces to $15.80 and look for a bounce there as confirmation that the breakout is on.
The other important element is the $15.80 price. Not only is it the breakout point for the cup and handle pattern, but it coincides to a price point which I believe was a major short-selling entry point [(fig 4)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778014693059067934/783103538602442812/GME_big_short.PNG).  Notice the nearly 20% gap down on 33 million of volume. This type of action doesn‚Äôt just happen with selling alone and I believe massive short positions were opened on that day. 

> This $15.80 then represents a breaking even point for those shorts if they have not closed their positions (and we have no real reason to believe they have). Breaking even is a huge psychological barrier for people when a trade isn‚Äôt going their way and often times represents an exit point for crowded positions. Most of the shorts were already underwater - above $15.80 and that water begins to boil. I believe this position is becoming borderline untenable for existing short positions and is a crowded and disastrous trade.
So to recap, $15.80 not only serves as an important chart pattern breakout point, but the proverbial ‚Äúline in the sand‚Äù for existing short positions.

JeffAmazon here again: Note Jay and I don‚Äôt agree on a few major points, but are nevertheless both seeing bullish action to come very very soon.



**5) Product Mix**

GameStop is expanding their product mix to include monitors, PC parts, and [more](https://gamerant.com/gamestop-vizio-tvs/). GME is no longer a Disc-Drive only store (which is fine itself), but an all-things-tech e-commerce growth start up. Or you can at least bet that‚Äôs the narrative.

GIVE ME THAT F-ING CHWY SALES MULTIPLE.

**6) Three signs of a bubble: leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus.**

This is an inverse bubble - it will rise as quickly as other bubbles drop. KBIO and VW are often quoted as short squeeze examples. Those are wrong comparisons. The only similarity is the fact that shorts were involved.

Instead, think of any other market bubble. It‚Äôs simply about leverage, lack of liquidity, and consensus. We have all 3 in GME. Everyone thinks GME will go like BlockBuster to $0 and is using leverage to short (by definition and current SI).

So instead, think of Burry‚Äôs 2008 MBS trade, Ackman‚Äôs 2020 COVID trade, PTJ‚Äôs Black Monday Trade, or Chanos‚Äô Enron trade. 

Same thing, different direction. Will go up as fast as the others went down.

And oh boy do we lack liquidity. Crowded party, one exit.


**7) Phenomenal numbers due to current console cycle.**

$GME bull Rod Alzmann [(Uberkikz on Stocktwits)](https://stocktwits.com/Uberkikz11) has great breakdowns on Q4 EPS/order count due to console cycle. He tracks orders by order number among a slew of other information [here](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann).

Check out his models. In short, we expect over $5 EPS in Q4 base case. Which is bananas.


**8) MSFT Partnership gross margin**

GME is getting free money from Satya Nadella.

[Conservative estimate $180M, 100% margin for 2 years](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment).


**9) January and April option OI**

OI in option calls for Jan and April are almost 4X that of Decembers. Is GME going to exercise the ITM calls for a squeeze? Why are they so insanely large? Who are these buyers? WTF are they doing?

No clue. But something is about to go down.

Note put call skew isn‚Äôt that low, so no infinity gamma squeeze yet, but it will come as GME obtains meme status.


**10) Most importantly, YOU.**

CNBC and other misled, egoistic mass media companies and institutional investors continue, time and time again, to look down upon the new generation of traders and laugh at WSB.

Tell me, which one of them has read all of Moody‚Äôs credit reports on GME? Which one of them live streams collaborative GME DD 20+ hours a week for 6+ months straight? Which one of them tracks order flows by the f-ing second based on skimmed CC data? Who scours r/GameStop to see how leadership is treating their employees and customers at a testimonial level? Do they even know about the bond repurchase?

They don‚Äôt know jack s-.


**Act 3 - The Trade**

What more evidence do you want? Time for action.

First, the PT. u/ronoron summed it up well:

> A 3 billion market cap (not even 0.5x of their revenues) would already leave GME at $46/share.Going back to their 2013 peak at around 6 billion market cap would leave them at almost $100/share already, not the $56 peak/share. The algos trading still can't appreciate the fact that GME halved its number of outstanding shares a while ago.

> For comparison. Bestbuy is trading at almost ~0.7x of revenues with lower gross margins. Nordstrom is almost at 0.4x of revenues despite the bigger liability their department stores are having through corona (never mind their uglier balance sheet). GME is still hovering just above 0.2x revenues because stinky shorts overestimated how bad corona would be for GME (e.g. delayed console cycle, digital consoles becoming widely popular).‚Äù

PT can easily be over $100. The JeffAmazon target is $420 which gives them about ~$25B market cap at a P/S ratio of 5, maybe 4 with console cycle revenue. That wouldn‚Äôt even be considered an euphoric price with today‚Äôs growth stocks. For comparison, NVDA is 22, TSLA is 20, and CHWY is 5.

Timing:
This all hinges on Dec 8 earnings. If GME misses (it historically has), Cohen will use this opportunity to attack leadership and take over as CEO. Therefore, GME leadership needs to provide a great earnings report or else Sherman will lose his job.

Here‚Äôs my responsible trade (do whatever you want): All in calls and shares now. If IV and $GME is sky-high before earnings, sell half to secure profit. If GME misses and tanks, bet your bottom dollar a takeover bid will be announced shortly.

In all honesty, I'm going to probably hold everything through earnings WSB style.

My positions:
1/15/21 $30Cs, shares

(I would buy April $30Cs too, but I'm all tapped out of cash).

Shorts and longs both have their cases. All the cards are on the table. Which side are you on?

-------

If I missed anything, comment and I will update above. I‚Äôm aiming to make this the final stop for all high-level GME DD.

*Edit 1: Educate yourself right now on IV crush (in short, we expect a lot of vol now, so option prices are high. After earnings, expected vol normally decreases, so your option prices will normally drop).  GME is the king of IV crush after earnings. If you're playing FDs, prepare to get destroyed like always. Safer bets are LEAPs or FDs after earnings.

*Edit 2: All these beat earnings recently: SNE, MSFT, BBY, BBBY, NTDOY, ATVI, TTWO, JWN, M, KSS"

Seems like puts are in order for all of these no rev, no cash, alt energy scrub stocks.
Any ideas who's next to the secondary offering pig trough?"
