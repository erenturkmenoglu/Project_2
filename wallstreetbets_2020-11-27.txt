CHOO CHOO MF’ER.All my old hobbies no longer entertain me, I haven't enjoyed a video game or TV show in years, completely jaded in regards to women, sick of my friends and I don't like what I do for a living. 

This is all I have. 

PLTR 50 EOY 🚀[deleted][deleted]i managed to order

* pltr 33c 12/24

and

* pltr 29c 12/4

my boomer dad was very upset yesterday when i told him i was trading options without knowing a single basic.PLTR 40 EODIs somebody eating their own shit by eod or what???I woke up like 5 times thinking about PLTRI’ve been outside GameStop for 8 hours so far. 4 to go. I’m fucking retardedWhat if pltr is using our data to figure out a way to pump their stock😳I’m excited there’s so much hype and institutional buying lately on PLTR and it’s only been trading for 2 months. Could be a 10x and it’s only 3x so far. I’m taking a shit so excuse my math but I think around $65 makes PLTR a $100 market cap. I really think that’s where it’s heading and a good chance that happens before the lock up period ends. Then I see Peter Thiel (the gay lover of my dreams) announcing an extension on the lock up causing the stock to soar even more. Next comes news about all the new government contracts and it goes fucking mental again. Then my sexy ass verse top says they need to do a stock split. By this point everyone who shorted the company is homeless but we rich PLTR holders donate to food drives and shelters to help them out. 

TLDR: I’m averaging up on PLTR.Anybody else get mildly annoyed when new guys here go, “hello retards, I’m new here, 100 dollar yolo play?” It’s like when the weird white kid uses the n word for street credif (sky==blue){

buy PLTR;

}

else {

buy more PLTR;

}DIS fires 32,000 more employees. 


#Minnie Mouse OnlyFans Coming Soon.holy shit THC🐝 you’re gonna make me BUSSPLTR really about to have another double digit day.BUY PLTR YOU RETARDS OR WE’LL BE DOING LUDES OUT OF HOOKERS ASSHOLES IN ANDROMEDA WITHOUT YOUimagine being the SEC agent designated to watch wsbPLTR: +3.8%

Autists: It’s deadWho bought PLTR calls this morning when it was at $33 raise ur hands 🙋‍♂️Upvote if you own PLTR but have no idea what they doI lost my cat last night. Edit: he ran away didn't die

I guess I'm not drinking alcohol any more. That cat was all I fucking had.Step PLTR what are you doing?I found this stock PLTR. Looks interesting. What do you guys think about it?Everyday I see hundreds of comments saying “I bought pltr calls at 15 and sold and 20 fuck I should have held im an idiot”. Yeah no shit but you didn’t know that then so who gives a fuck take your profits and move on enough with this hindsight bullshitPLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTR PLTROK SLUTS LISTEN UP

PLTR pump to resume next week.

Rest up, enjoy the weekend
😘😘😘Told my father in law to buy PLTR coz its gonna keep mooning and he texted me at open saying he bought 5k worth of shares. he isn't replying to my messages telling him to buy the dip... think i fucked up herePLTR! you show me a pay stub for 35 eod and I quit my job right now and work for you.Why do I feel PLTR go up to 40 by end of next week?I showed my dad WSB last night and he was howling. He’s a boomer stock picker that watches Cramer daily too....Needless to say I downloaded Reddit on his phone and got him some 0dte  $PLTR calls like a good son*what did you do on your friday night?*

watch a retard eat shitStop selling your PLTR positions you fucks.# I'M NOT FUCKING SELLINGOn Thursday PLTR dropped $3 and then sky rocketed. Hold through this, average down shares if you bought at the top.

Will end today around 34 and monday should be a rocket too 

PLTR Yolo gang 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀PLTR +5%

Bears: Told you soFor all you weak hands out there think of this.

1) PLTR has a huge moat.  CIA and agencies arent going to just work with any software company for this type of data. This is 17 years worth of trust.  

2) There is a new EV company that pops up every day. We all know that the market is based on category killers. Amazon, FB, AAPL, GOOG, etc.. each are the kings of their respective areas. I just dont see another PLTR popping up overnight like an XPEV, LI or NIO has to compete with TSLA

3) Never betting against paypal mafia

4) 55% rev growth and profitable (excluding stock compensation)

&#x200B;

HOLD THE WALL.Palantir is helping with vaccine distribution networks with ALL major vaccine companies starting next week. Do with that as you will.I've never seen this place so fucking hyped on a single stonk 😂😂MONEY GO PLTRRRRRRRRRCRSR starting guys 🚀🌛Don’t know what THC🐝 is but I’m up 30%. Thank you whoever was did that DD last weekTuscan Raiders rise up!Did CIIC gang turn into THC 🐝 gang?Buckle up THC 🐝is taking off 🚀🚀🚀The market will stay open later if PLTR passes $40. NYSE just informed meWSJ pumping PLTR, literally cannot go tits up nowLmao CNBC just said that wsb broke the vix*PLTR opens 13% green*

*Goes down 5%*

*Actual retards: "IT'S DEAD"*

BTFDi thought i got banned i was so scared don't do that again i felt aloneOnly on WSB, no really, literally no other stock forum, can a +3% day be considered a massacre.PLTR LES GOOO PLTR GANG WHERE YOU AT**P**lease

**L**et

**T**endies

**R**iseWow PLTR.. you have the audacity to bring my whole portfolio to up ONLY 15% INSTEAD OF 50%? 

Diamond hands in lambos, paper hands in shambles.God I'm a pussy for sellingI envy the PLTR holders who thought the market was closed today and check their accounts on Monday to see nothing happened.

It’s like the stock had a Ferris Bueller’s day off kind of thing where it had wacky adventures and the parents come back home to see everything is fineIf you sold PLTR today you’ve got toilet paper hands. #AutistsHaving longer dated calls on PLTR that are up 800-1000% feels like being a aristocrat or something.  
  
You can watch all the weekly holders scrambling around in a panic and just sip your tea from your carriage and splash a mud puddle at them as you roll by.I panic sold NIO after Citron short sold them. Not again. You'll have to pry these PLTR calls and shares from my cold dead hands you gay fucking bears.Re PLTR

Grab a glass of water before panic selling. Reflect on the question, "Why is my time horizon 3 minutes?" By the time you figure that out, the recovery will probably have already begun. Lots of overly nervous, dehydrated, short-sighted people today.Not buying more PLTR but definitely not selling either. One red day doesn’t define the stock.To be honest this small PLTR pullback makes me feel a bit safer with it.Me and the boys after buying PLTR calls at ATH 3 hours ago  :  🤡🤡🤡moment of silence for PLTR fomo gangPLTR still closed above its daily upper Bolinger band despite the attack, there is absolutely no sign yet that this is even slightly bearish and not healthy consolidation.People been asking for a dip to buy more PTLR and then it actually dips and people lose their minds.Are yall forgetting what happened when 🌈🐻citron shorted NIO? Fell 4$ then mooned up to 53. PLTR AINT DONE FOR BITCHCES. CITRON GAVE US BLACK FRIDAY SALE. PLTR 40$ MONDAYYou mean Daily Discussion PLTR thread right?BREAKING: UFO ACCELERATING TO THE OUTER LABIA OF THE EARTH’S STRATOSPHERE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS CRSR. 55 EODam the only person on this board who didn't buy into PLTR, please no AMA i'm too depressedCurrent positions: doggy behind a hookerSell my house and buy PLTR calls?It's pretty insane that citron put out that tweet at 10:08 when PLTR reached its absolute bottom today. Just taking advantage of people's fear to benefit their position. I hope they lose everythingAnyone else remember when citron put a $5 EOY price target on PTON lmao 😂 what a bunch of 🤡

https://citronresearch.com/citron-updates-peloton/PLTR INVESTORS BE LIKE 

“ GOOGLE HOW CAN I REVERSE A DONATION TRANSACTION “Palantir is going to scour the web and find all the dirt on citron and get them closed down in the coming weeksRe PLTR

The same tools who panic sell on a moments notice because of a tweet from Citron Research are the same ones who will hop right back in once they see even a mediocre rally. Some probably already have. If you feel silly for selling at 26, you should.The year is 2030. 
Forbes is doing an article on millennial millionaires.  
90% of millennial millionaires created their wealth from a meme stock in 2020 call PLTR. 
To this day we still don’t know what the company does.Anyone in PLTR right now should be PRAYING it opens well under $30. More likely to spike at open.  If this shit touches $29 I’m definitely playing 12/4 for a day trade.i love it when my portfolio pops the same amount premarket that i will end up making IN AN ENTIRE FUCKING DAY AT MY DUMBASS JOB. how the fuck am i supposed to work under these conditions?Only on WSB will a dip be when the stock is still fucking up 8% on the day.


This is not a dip on PLTR lmao


Now CRSR? That’s a dip.CITRON is short shelling PLTR, Fuck them up for what they did to NIO!!

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀That helms deep PLTR meme was a prophecy. Gandalf is coming.PLTR diamond hands rise up and say it with me

[I'M NOT FUCKING LEAVING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF7M0FISH5Y)Palantards paid a very expensive options trading academy tuition todayT H C B to the moon
G M E to marsWas jogging this morning and found 2 dollars on the ground. That’s all I needed. All in on pltr 40 12/31 callsPLTR bulls, Citron called PLTR a lottery. Lets fucking put some money where our mouths are and get this shit back to ATH. Show them that the lottery is controlled by us autists, not their "ReSeARch FiRM" Cant believe what Citron does is legal tbhIf we are majority stakeholders in PLTR let's just do a stock split upvote if you agreeHilarious that this entire sub is acting like PLTR is crashing and burning, while it’s up 4% on the day.##Giving PLTR a rare 5-rocketship rating 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀PLTR: Up 60% just this week alone. 

WSB: Ah yes, this seems like a fantastic entry point, I will invest my entire IRA in this!

PLTR: Has one red day.

WSB: 😮Suddenly my family members who I convinced to buy PLTR now hate mePLTR 38$ EODUpvote if you don't research your stocks, and just buy whatever WSB tells you toWhile trying to explain Palantir to family members my uncle interrupts and says, "the fucking peanut company? No one makes money on peanuts."

Goddamn I do not want to be that oldPLTR is going to break off from the NYSE and become it’s own stock exchange#FUCK CITRON WSB RUNS THE SHOW NOW PLTR 35 EODPLTR’s lowest point today was +1.17% and y’all are calling for the end of times 😭😭Longest 3min of my lifeSTOP THE COUNTPLTR at prices not seen since Wednesday!I'm not annoyed of PLTR dropping I'm more annoyed of you fucks panicking today. Last friday it happened it's doing it againPLTR holders: look at last Friday's chart, then look at Monday's chart, then look up at the moon and pick out a nice little plot to stand on“Damn, I wish there was a pull back or a dip to buy.”

<<<dip happens>>>

***crickets***If you arent Yoloing on pltr you ain’t American# oh shit PLTR big dick before openIf PLTR goes to 40, i will eat my moms shitYou asked for a PLTR dip, whining all week right? this is your last chance.15 Upvotes and I’ll buy 5000 Palantir sharesPLTR EOD 33-34Going all in on pltr calls at open . Last 4K to my name I’ll either be behind Wendy’s sucking dick or giving my family a good xmasWill PLTR end 35 today?I know everyone here likes crazy gains like 500% and shit, but I bought Nov 2021 PLTR $30 calls a few days ago and I sold this morning for a 100% gain. I have finally breached the 10k barrier on my account and I am happy as fuck. I do plan on buying those calls back another day, but for now I'll just accept my gains and not FOMO back in. Never selling my 2022 calls though.PLTR just gonna keep bouncing off $30. If it gets close to $29.9 just keep buying. This fucker is dildo rocket to Saturn. 🍆 🚀 🪐Jesus, the paper hands in this sub. I saw this fucking price on PLTR on WednesdayFor people panic selling the circus is that way ---->In case anyone forgot....PLTR is aggressively hiring. Company is growning. They've hit every quarterly revenue projection. And they are working with multiple international agencies and tracking COVID vaccine distributions which is globally one of the most watched over events to come.FUCK CITRON ALL MY HOMIES HATE CITRONBought 500 more PLTR shares. I’m not letting this one slip through my fingers.If you bought PLTR puts go ahead and rip up the invite to my bday party.

The petting zoo and bouncy slide are for Palantards ONLY.All Citron has to do is see which stock you all are shilling nonstop, take a short position, and then announce said short position - causing mass selling since meme pumps are held by paper hands. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy and free moneyIt's warming to see people helping others out with PLTR gains. Feels like it's been a long time since the sub last did that with Tesla's first big run.CRSR gang.

It's startingNot going to lie I was really sleepy and going to crash but after seeing THC🅱️ IM READY TO RUN THROUGH A WALLREMEMBER BOYS. WE WILL SEE PROFIT TODAY BUT.

MAN YOU GONNA EAT THAT SHITIf you’re selling PLTR because of Citron, you just have a tiny cock.YALL BETTER BUY PLTR NOW WHILE YOU CAN🤝Bought PLTR again, made $24 then sold it. Getting cracker barrel nowRe PLTR

It's like a lot of you only think in 30 second increments and quickly develop amnesia. Before making panic selling decisions, pause for, I don't know, 15 minutes. 

If you're in this for the very, very short term, the same crowds that panic sold over the last hour will be the same ones that will swing it back.Holding PLTR through the weekend?Bears aren’t very productive on PLTR... citron announcement + all the negativity, and it’s only dropped to $28...Yo thic 🐝 be churning that HONEY right now sonnyAnyone making money from APXT needs to take a moment and be thankful for Jeffrey Epstein.

You need to have a keen eye and be well positioned to jump on fresh, young businesses that show potential and are still in their infancy.Holy shit. Tsla went from -2% to +2% premarket. Wild! This thing is going 600 eod for surePLTR beyond ridiculous at this point.Pltr 35 EODPLTR LES GOOOOOO 40😎🚀🚀🚀🚀Dude I literally go so excited about buying PLTR I bought PLT instead. How retarded am I? I made $9 though“Guys PLTR went from +14% to only +6% SHOULD I SELL???” Jesus Christ its been half an hour since market opened can yall give it a minute lmaoBought at the top 🤝Citron announces short. People who believe their word is gold sell. Citron starts buying to cover the short position that’s fucked them since 22 a share. Stock goes back up.

PTLR to the moonIf you don't love PLTR at 29 today then you don't deserve PLTR at 35 🤬🤬🤬Thought I got banned for a second, almost shit myselfIf PLTR ends above $33 next Friday I will post the letter I got from Martin Shkreli about a year and a half ago from the Metropolitan Detention Center.PLTR only up 4%, half this sub gonna $ROPEThe fact that reddit is bitching about PLTR going 5% after a 60% run in the past week is making me lose faith in the sub.

RIPI’m still PLTR gang. If you ain’t then you never wereI’m actually going to be selling PLTR this morning. I bought $20,000 at $15.38 so I’m going to make the gains realized today.

Could it go up more? Absolutely, but I’m going to keep my greed at a minimum. Plus, thanks to PLTR: my account is at an all time high, I’ve made back the money that I spent on a Jeep and a new wedding ring for the wife, the kids will have a great Christmas, I’m going snowboarding, and I’m getting the new Xbox and a 75” 4K.

Sure, if you bought at 33 this morning expecting it to hit 40, the slide looks especially hard. But remember: this is only a half day, a slow day overall, and the stock was hit with an unusually aggressive hit piece.

Monday, there's a strong likelihood of a rally as people look at the price and realize it's a great buying opportunity.APHA up 3.5% premarket already. Gonna hit 7.5 today. 

Next week it's going up another dollar at least.🐝🚀get on the THC B and APXT train before its too late!!! up massive pre market guys no joke 🚀Why is THC🅱️ banned ?HAHAHA PLTR breaks 31 before market even opensHolding 15k in cash and somehow feel the urge to just go all in on 1 memeFINE THEN, force me into it, 600 more share of PLTR.If only I could put my entire 401k into PLTR🐝🐝🐝CRSR just turned the rocket engine ON. 🚀🚀🚀🚀Porn title of the day goes to "Step bro why you act like a scarecrow to trick us?"12/04 35c 12/04 40c 12/18 35c 12/18 40c
