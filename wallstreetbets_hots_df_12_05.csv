There were a lot of fake entries, so let me address that.

**1) These guys are not good at what they do**

Most of the fake entries are obvious, for example [here](https://imgur.com/YDgeFOm) and [here](https://imgur.com/DamT0zE).

Others are less obvious, with random numbers spread out over a wider period of time. But it's not easy to create legit-looking entries and have an impact since they can't see the whole data set.

There were so many that I couldn't go through all the responses in a detailed way, and was more conservative to exclude more responses than necessary. Unfortunately, I'm also hiding the category column and grouped duplicates, outliers, fake entries into the Excluded category so that I don't provide any helpful feedback to fakers. Apologies for removing transparency for the sake of countering spoilers.

If we really wanted to stop the fakers, we would ask for email addresses, but then no one would fill out the form. But it doesn't matter anyways, because...

**2) Fake entries don't even matter much, since it just has to be in the ballpark**

Surveys have a huge margin of error and only have to be directionally correct (see recent political polls). The fakers think they're playing 4D chess but are actually playing Candyland... and losing to 4 year-olds. They have the logical skills of GME shorts (which they probably are). 

**3) The main benefit of the survey is social proof**

From all the responses and all the shares, it's obvious we are a force to be reckoned with. We hold great power, and with great power come great tendies. The next time you get weak hands (next Wed), remember everyone else holding until a squeeze. Even if you have the most delicate, princess hands, hold at least through Q4 earnings and the annual shareholder meeting in April.

I am so confident we are going down next week that I'm willing to make another bet. I will donate $100 to the top 10 upvoted commentors below if SPY closes below $360 by next Friday.

On the other hand, if SPY closes above $375 next Friday I will get a tattoo of Jpow's face above the words ""Don't Fight The Fed"" on my ass. This will serve as a lifelong reminder that the Fed does have true power and isn't a deflationary scam operation pumping up meaningless bank reserve accounts which aren't being lent out and aren't entering the economy (which is the actual truth). If anyone wants to go ahead and design a black-and-white Banksy style image of that for me ahead of time I'll pay you for the efforts if I decide to use it. But I won't need to because this shit is GOING DOWN FOLKS!!!

This is the single largest bet I've ever made on a single play in my 20 years of trading. I wouldn't have done that if I wasn't extremely confident in my thesis and my timing. Most of you will all repeat the same thing. ""You are early, should have gone for X month."" As if you retards could time a market crash lmfao...

I will either have a tattoo reminding me of my worst bet ever and the need to be safer in the future, or I will have cash taken from the same retarded hands who bought the top and called me an idiot while doing it...

## NIO Recap

**0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:**

* *""If NIO breaks support at 44.06 ish or bounces off resistance at 47.85 ish, expect downwards PT of 44.03 - 38.53 and below.*
* *Play: 42p 12/04 exp or 43p 12/04 (only play in the morning)""*

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 47.90

High: 45.16

Low: 41.65

Close: 43.04

&#x200B;

**It would help if you closed your position when NIO hit 41.65. No diamond hands.**

**Monthly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:** 

* *""If NIO breaks support at around 44.41, look for 37.32 by 12/7 - 12/9 and 35.97 by 12/8 - 12/14.""*
* *Play $30p 12/16 exp""*

&#x200B;

**Monthly Outlook**

On the 1D timeframe, NIO doesn't have support until 33.56. However, a pivot point sits at 40.54.

Theoretically, a pivot point is a price level used by professional traders to assess whether prices are bullish or bearish.

""If the prevailing market price is above the base pivot point, it suggests bullishness. If the market is below the base pivot, it suggests a bearish tenor.""

On 12/2, NIO reached through the pivot point and jumped back up, creating a long wicked heilkin ashi. Notice how the open and high prices are currently synched on the downtrend? Theoretically, this indicates a STRONG bearish momentum. 

The next support level on the 1D timeframe sits at 33.16

**Currently, the 30p 12/18 is still in play.** 

Dec. Sentiment: Bearish

## AMD Recap

0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:

* *If AMD breaks resistance at 94.02, look for PT 94.75 - 96.08+*
* *Play: 94c or 95c 12/04 exp (only play in the morning)*

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 92.58

High: 94.58

Low: 90.63

Close: 94.04

**Dec. Sentiment: Neutral (may have reached the top but let's see)**

# TSLA RECAP

Weekly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post *(I called it 0DTE on the last post. My mistake)*: 

1. If TSLA breaks through resistance at 595.68, look for a price target of 621.85 between 12/4 - 12/8+
2. Play 620c 12/11 exp.

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 591.01

High: 599.04

Low: 585:50

Close: 599.04

&#x200B;

It would have helped if you didn't close your positions.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a87r5bzmcc361.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=371bc03781ba8e12d36add9b2bbc3cb469c29413

TSLA extended its uptrend support and has currently wedged itself into a rising wedge (bearish). 

&#x200B;

**12/7 Weekly Outlook**

Tesla needs a nice pop on Monday to the resistance of the rising wedge, which is right near the resistance level of 622.66. It exceeds that price, then the bearish wedge has failed, and TSLA's sentiment will be bullish.

&#x200B;

**Dec. Sentiment: Neutral (may have reached the top but let's see)**

&#x200B;

# PLTR Recap

Weekly and Monthly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post *(I called it 0DTE on the last post. My mistake)*: 

* *If PLTR closes above 27.48, then look for a PT of 32.87 between 12/11 and 12/18.*
* *Play 34c 12/11 exp. or 34c 12/18 exp*
* *If PLTR breaks support around 22.86 the look for a PT of 21.22 - 16.02 between 12/11 and 12/18 (For some reason, I didn't include a position for this possibility. For next weeks prediction that will drop Monday morning, ill provide a prediction)*

&#x200B;

**Monthly Outlook**

PLTR is deciding whether to bounce off uptrend support or leap out. We will have a more precise direction at close on Monday. 

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 24.88

High: 25.24

Low: 23.51

Close: 23.85

&#x200B;

It would have helped if you didn't open a weekly/monthly position because PLTR didn't close around 27.48, and I didn't provide a position for the bearish possibility. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b8rmmxm4dc361.png?width=3912&format=png&auto=webp&s=612627ea36e27545c1945a4f2b7ba9729fb122fe

0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:

* If PLTR bounces off resistance at 24.37, look for a price target around 22.36 - 18.64.
* Play 22.5p 12/04 exp

**I'll mark this one as a loss. Not good enough.**

&#x200B;

BUT it would have helped if you closed your 0DTE position when PLTR hit 23.51

This has been talked about here for months now so bear with me as I needed a place to rant.

Like many, I’ve been following most of these EV companies since the summer. I mean who isn’t enticed by seeing people make 300% in a month? It’s completely rationale to want and get in on the action. Hell, I consider myself a conservative investor and even I’ve made money on some of these names so I guess you can call me a hypocrite for even writing this.

At some point though one has to recognize just how irrational this has become. No revenue until 2025? No problem, here’s a $17 BILLION market cap (talking about you quant scape). Go onto any EV/SPAC forum or Stocktwits and dare to question a valuation or why a stock tripled in a week. Ask about the potential dilution from warrants or PIPE shares set to go out. You’ll likely just get a cocky response about having FOMO. These bulls are getting so caught up in the moment with short term gains, it reminds of those 2 Florida real estate guys from The Big Short:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfu_iFS-UY8

Take PIC for example. Traded around its NAV (basically a price floor before merger) for months before abruptly surging. Nothing has changed about the company -  no new catalysts other than rumors of a potential merger date which is widely expected. What is the rationale for paying double what the company was valued at a couple weeks ago? These SPACs are becoming commodities in a sense that it’s solely supply/demand driven by hype and literally nothing else. 

I guess to me the worst part of all this and why it bothers me so much is that 99.9% of the time it will be that average Joe who eventually loses cause they put too much of their savings into a SPAC at $50 after watching some pumper from YouTube who used bright colors and 500% gains In the thumbnail. 

You know who wins 99.9% of the time? Institutions and hedge funds. They are eating this up. Whether it is just shorting these risky stocks or taking advantage of the arb opportunities. I’ve counted 6 recently merged SPACs that have significant spreads between the common stock and warrants. Arbitrageurs are locking in these gains - eventually taking retail money. 

I know I sound lame but this EV hype is getting dangerous and people need to be aware of how this will end. Some will make money short term and know when to get out but a lot of ignorant people are going to lose money once the dust settles with all this.

31,"Listen retards, CRM should be your major easy-money move next week (fool-proof instructions inside)",380,k6z2fs,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6z2fs/listen_retards_crm_should_be_your_major_easymoney/,134,"**Basics**

Salesforce is a San Fransisco company that offers **C**ustomer **R**elation **M**anagement software (and hence the symbol CRM). It's not a  joke company like many other shilled on WSB. Salesforce has a market cap of $200 billion and is one of the 30 companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).

**What Happened**

This is the price chart for Salesforce (CRM) last week:

https://preview.redd.it/9sqm4nur2a361.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e71b4aee8595c1e3a5a2f1220fedc017c21153f2

The sharp drop happened right after the earning call. Was the earnings number disappointing? No, in fact, it was stellar. While the average expected EPS was $0.75 per share, the actual number turned out to be $1.74.

But Salesforce also announced that it's in the process of acquiring Slack (WORK) for 27.7 billion dollars. Some experts said Salesforce is overpaying for Slack and a huge sell-off followed, resulting in a 40 billion drop in Salesforce market cap.

So, think about it. Salesforce acquires a company for 27.7 billion and its market cap goes down by 40 billion. In other words, 2+2=3, while usually with a merger you expect 2+2=5.

**What Happened Next**

After the initial shock, analysts and the public started to reassess the situation, and many actually praised the acquisition.

Jim Cramer (the guy who is the WSB for boomers) [said ""Salesforce Has 100% Upside After Buying Slack""](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-salesforce-100-upside-173302345.html). He's been shilling the stock on his show every day as well.

Multiple analysts upgraded their Salesforce recommendation to Strong Buy and raised their price target.

Since then, the initial price gap has been filled a little. The price is currently about $226. But a full recovery to pre-EC prices ($240s) and higher seems imminent.

Traders have a ""3-Day Rule"" according to which they don't touch a stock that has fallen sharply and suddenly for 3 days to let it sink to its lowest and see where it goes from there. Those 3 days for CRM are passed and it seems to be rising.

**What's Coming**

[Salesforce Investor day](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/Investor-Day-2020/default.aspx) is on Tuesday (Dec 8) in the morning. They will probably clarify the necessity of the slack acquisition and their plans to profitably integrate it into their core business.

Also, a lot of institutions see this drop as a good opportunity to get in, so the demand is high.

**What Positions**

Do NOT buy weekly or far OTM options. Consider the following (ranked from riskiest to safest):

**When to Buy**

Do not FOMO. I don't want you to buy in pre-market or when it starts high on Monday and then curse my name when it goes down some in 2 hours.

I think this will certainly go up, both short term and long term,  but there will be dips along the way. Wait for the dips to buy in."

54,NNOX - radiologist's DD,13,k7ai6r,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7ai6r/nnox_radiologists_dd/,15,"I've been lurking here for years for the hilarious memes. It's time for me to actually contribute something.

I've been a radiologist for years. I watched NNOX's RSNA (Disneyland for radiology) presentation. I attended RSNA virtually for professional reasons of course. I'm going to keep this as short and simple as possible. 

Background on NNOX and x-rays

NNOX proposes a room-temp, ?cheaper electron gun to make x-rays, as opposed to the currently used hot electron gun. Keep in mind x-rays have a lot more parts than just the electron gun (target, bucky, brightness control). X-rays are used in radiographs (2D picture), tomosynthesis (fancy x-ray that allows you to determine depth, requires 180degrees view), and CT scans (requires 360degrees view). 

What did NNOX present?

A human hand radiograph and dummy tomosynthesis using their gun. Nothing I saw was technologically shocking. In fact, I read hundreds of radiographs and dozens of tomo images this week. Side note, him comparing his hand x-ray next to Dr. Rotengen's first medical x-ray from >100years ago was a little tachy, like putting your selfie next to a portrait of jesus. 

Sentiment

Very few people have heard of them in the professional imaging community. I can't find any scientific papers about their tech. Kinda sus...

Regulatory

I'm sure they'll get their 510(k) approved. That's a really low bar. 

My thoughts on their proposal

Pay-per-scan x-ray, AI/cloud/network/\*insert tech buzzword here\*-based interpretation. Major healthcare systems just would not go for that. EVen assuming their tech is both cost-effective and non-inferior, their proposal disrupts (not in a good way) too many things simultaneously (radiologists' and technologists' workflow, reimbursement, existing vendors etc.). Don't get too excited about AI in radiology btw. It's underwhelming at best. 

I'm sure they have valid use cases though - such as rural areas, developing countries (if you're investing, think about the TAM here). I believe their team isn't out to scam people, like NKLA or Theranos. I just wish they would open their technology to peer review and quash any doubts. 

My positions

No position in NNOX. I don't feel like backing or shorting them. Unless something changes, I'll just watch from the sidelines. 

If I turn out to be horribly wrong, feel free to rub it in. 

Long TDOC and butterfly. 

I'm working today and tomorrow, so don't expect any prompt replies."
55,MUFG DD,22,k7712b,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7712b/mufg_dd/,50,"TL;DR: MUFG's price is way under the actual value of the stock. The MUFG $5 2/19/21 Call option at .10 is beyond undervalued.

Yesterday, I posted my [gains chart for the past month](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6u2m2/thank_you_all_for_changing_my_life/) where I've consistently been moving up to what amounted to a +780.93% return on investments. I did this through personal research into stocks, statistics, value ratios, and game theory. I've listened to what successful people were doing on this sub and modified it for my own personal strategy.

People have been asking what my positions were so I've decided to start doing write ups. I'm currently invested in 12 companies, most which have already made me profits. My strategy is simple, find companies that are very undervalued and compare the risk to reward ratios for the various call options.

Today, I want to tell you about MUFG. 


**Value Ratios**


Earning per share - .24

Price per Book - .36

Projected Earning Growth - .83

Annual Dividend is at 5.29%

These numbers by themselves tell me that the current price of MUFG is way below what the actual value of the stocks are. These value ratios mean that the stock price is heavily incentivized to go up.

This company has already hit two major floors, one being the major sell-off since it's high at just over $8 down to a floor of around $5, and a floor of $3.43 after the Coronavirus sell-off. I'm not worried about this stock crashing anymore because it has already crashed as hard as it can. It is currently making it's recovery.

In January, Biden will take over as president and I anticipate many policies will be made to get an actual economic recovery underway. I don't believe this has been priced into MUFG's current price yet. 

I understand this is a Japanese company, but we have to understand that the stocks in an American stock market are pushed mainly by American investors. Once more Americans have disposable income, there will be more money thrown into the stock market, and I believe that if the actual value of MUFG doesn't entice investors, it's 5.29% dividend will.

Options for this stock are pretty low volume. I bought 50 shares of MUFG $5 2/19/21 at an average of .12 per share. This is a price I would expect for a weekly expiration, not one in February. In order to profit, the stock needs to hit $5.13 by 2/19.

The floor of this stock before the Pandemic was already at $5 and was making a recovery before Covid struck. I don't see how this stock does not eventually go back up to it's floor of $5, if not surpass that floor and go on to $6 or $7.

Again, at calls prices at .10, I felt that it would be ludicrous to not throw something in and see if I'm right.

After it's first major sell off, MUFG hovered around $5 a share before it started going back up. This was stopped by the Coronavirus outbreak, which caused another sell off to $3.43 in March. Ever since then, this stock has been making a slow, but steady climb up.

The stock has already grown 28% since hitting it's floor in March. It showed recent highs of 4.62 on 11/17 and 11/24. In order for it to hit 5.13, the stock needs to grow just 16.85% more.

Unless something crazy happens, I don't see how this stock doesn't hit at least $5.13 by the time this option expires. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this stock was around $6 or $6.5 by the time all is said and done.

Once people realize the value of this company, people will buy shares. Once people buy shares, people will realize that the options are valuable. Once people realize that, the price of the option should go up.

For $12 and option, I am giving myself the opportunity to make a huge return on investment if my math and logic are right. If it doesn't hit, I've really not lost that much money.

How did I make 780.93% return on the stock market this past month? These are the types of bets I make. I've had more hits than misses, and the hits easily outweigh the misses.

If you liked this write-up and would like more, I'm happy to present write-ups for some of my other positions. I have call options for TROX (Already up 59.22% with an expiration in 2/19), UNM (bought at .20, up to .53, exp. 3/19), KNOP, LFC, SPTN, GTN, PTVE, AMKR, CS, and TKC. Please fill free to nitpick, ask questions, or shoot my theory down. The more we work together, the better chance we have at actually finding bets that make profits."

He is demanding that PornHub have monitors for all media on the site and ID verification for age to all actors performing all...scenes (makes me laugh thinking about a chick taking two dicks in the butt as a scene).

[Bills 12/5/20 Tweets](https://twitter.com/billackman/status/1335244145699528704?s=21)

This goes against the PornHub model...also is demanding the business to take on much more labor than its current cash burn rate.  It really makes you wonder how quickly rumors make it up the chain to senior management.

Outside of just the sheer amount of labor involved with trying to legitimize these businesses (does not fit the Q1 2021 timeline to get these guys above the board) there is no possible way that Bill, Baupost, Guggenheim, the Ontario teachers union would be seeded to heavy in the SPAC just for it to come out as PornHub and hounded for supporting a business who profits off of the exploitation of Minors and Rape.

With Docebo Learn (LMS), enterprises have the ability to centralize and organize courses, distribute and manage online and instructor-led courses, track certifications and measure results with dashboards and custom analytics. Docebo Learn (LMS) is powered by AI, automatically tagging learning content and making it easier to find.

Docebo also provides accompanying modules to Docebo Learn include Docebo Coach & Share (AI Powered Social Learning)**,** enabling learning in the flow of work with informal and experiential learning opportunities and Docebo Perform (skills gap management), helping organizations empower their people through skills gap analysis and improving employee competencies with targeted learning programs based on the current and future skills need of your business.

&#x200B;

# Customers:

Docebo has over 2,000 business customers, including the following:

**Thomson Reuters, Heineken, DocuSign, OpenTable, Wal-Mart, and** ***Amazon***\*\*.\*\*

They recently secured a contract with Amazon to provide the training and certification for AWS. This is huge for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

# Financials:

Docebo isn't profitable (duh), but they have massive revenue growth. For Q3, their revenue grew 60% YoY, with over 10% quarterly revenue growth.

Stock is currently valued at $1.46B. Considering their growth, recently securing their largest contract, and potential upside at less than $1.5B, I think there is massive potential here.

# 

# Everything else:

Docebo IPO'd literally two days ago, so you still have time to get in \*early\*. Wouldn't that be nice? Getting into a stock \*before\* the 200% run up? Obviously there's more risk but you know for sure you aren't buying the top of a pump.

With WFH being a more permanent change in corporate culture, Docebo will be at the forefront of a changing trend and will continue to be in significant demand.

Could potentially expand into University and K-12 education in the future as another avenue for growth. With online and hybrid education becoming bigger, tools like Docebo will be extremely useful.

Retard factor: It's an SaaS cloud computing AI company. How many of these that recently IPO'd haven't gone up 1000 fucking percent?"

*Disclaimer: Yes. Stocks go up, down, and even sideways. If you don't understand this post, then I will pray for you. I've included bullish and bearish plays. It's up to you to decide which one to take based on your own analysis. Most of you just went from a 5% chance of making money to a 50% chance of making money. Congrats! All kidding aside, I love you friends but please don't message me asking where the stock is going and what positions you should take during market open. I'm just too busy. Sorry. I'll try to answer questions during the market close.*

The market sentiment was weak this week because of the SaaS sector earnings risks and the desire of hedge funds to get in cheaper for a second December rally. HOHOHO.

Salesforce got hammered to create enough delta for a gap up back to $250+ for accumilation. 

Snowflake couldn't stay down and its valuation is absurd, approxiamtely the size of IBM.

Palantir will retest $30 and breakout, just because SNOW did. ($370s) It's up to 2.5X PLTR market capitalization with half the revenue and an operating loss of 14 million. These SNOW investors paid up early for next year 2022. All the Warren Buffett hype and it's paid for WallStreet IPO client/Brokerage PR bias shilling (even by Cramer who won't support PLTR because of the Direct Listing model as an ex-hedge fund manager)

Facebook's underwriters were Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Barclays and Allen & Co. - and they fucked Facebook with a botched roadshow and  didn't say anything meaningful to shore up its 16 month share price collapse. 

They were too busy being bearish on FB and probably shorted it themselves, especially Goldman Sachs. 

Peter Thiel is a Director on the Facebook Board and remembers what low value paying $350 million for IPO offers.

Thiel and Karp dumped very cheap shares on the first trading day to provide liquidity and Wall Street was (by law very neutral but with a bearish vibe with chicken little risky risky!!!) 

This company would have been IPO listed at $35 a share, still making it much cheaper than the Snowflake IPO. But you can't withhold Wallstreet its tendie tribute. Thiel took it directly to the exchange. 

Meme stock or not, I'm disappointed to see the lack of faith in this company because of a broad market shakeout. $21 was a great entry point, but people expect to realize their ideal oversold wet dream. The Germans are bullish still calling it the next Tesla fairy-tale story. Karp is phil-German and speaks fluently while studying in Frankfurt for years and considers it his cultural homeland. Thiel is German American. So was Wernher Von Braun...*cough Elon Musk the South African/Canadian of Dutch ancestory.

Real estate investor here. If no one buys a home at all in 2021 buying GHIV still works and this is why:

Homeowners rolling over old mortgages into new ones accounted for 62 percent of all lending activity in the second quarter of 2020, up from 54.5 percent of loans in the first quarter of 2020 and from 39.6 percent in the second quarter of 2019.

Even your grandma is getting a refi for 2.5%, and she owned her house outright. Good job grandma.

Metro areas with at least 1 million people that saw refinance activity at least doubled, year over year, in the second quarter of 2020 included Washington, DC (up 219.9 percent); Milwaukee, WI (up 213.1 percent); Austin, TX (up 211.9 percent); Raleigh, NC (up 205.3 percent) and Birmingham, AL (up 198.4 percent).

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers.

They play the middle. They don't hold the loans. They don't employ bankers. They use independent brokers. They are transactional, and there is ALOT of transactions in this current low interest economy.

Homeowners deal with the company's loan servicing department. Founded in 1986, United Wholesale Mortgage is headquartered in Pontiac, Michigan, and is one of the top wholesale lenders in the country.

Ok, cool but what makes them special?

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), the #1 wholesale mortgage lender, set a company record of $107.7 billion in mortgage loan volume in 2019, more than doubling it’s 2018 production of $41.5 billion. In doing so, it broke the wholesale industry record of $103.3 billion of mortgage loan volume previously set in 2005 by Countrywide Financial. UWM also secured the title of #1 wholesale lender for the fifth year in a row which has never been done before in the industry.

These guys are literally the McDonalds of mortgages. Their rates are the lowest, their fees are the lowest, and they are the most competitive all around. Their growth and numbers prove it. 

Now before you wet your pants with excitement. 2021 will see some downturn in the housing market due to foreclosures. This may or may not effect the mortgage industry on paper, but it could drive down sentiment. So if you have the patience, this is a solid play for long term with room for alot of growth.

Either way, if you don't buy the stock, you need to give these fuckers a call. 1.99% on a 30 year fixed if you qualify, and if you would save money by getting the mortgage refi, use that savings to buy the stock, then you don't have to come out of pocket.

For those of you who missed the CRM Calls purchase point Wednesday morning and know what the fuck you are doing, I think writing the shit out CRM Puts is still a money move. But I suppose some people might want a cheaper call premium play, with less news and shit, and most you fucking idiots need all the help you can get. 

BBY is another strong options play, I’ll be looking to purchase early next week based on futures and overall market sentiment. But another drop today closed the deal for me. Sticking with ATM calls due to low cost, and we could definitely fall into the 95 range briefly. 

Weekly puts are incredibly cheap, consider mildly protecting your call position over the next two weeks if investing significant equity (sell them fast though!). But this decline is undoubtedly near an end and this bitch is turning around shortly for a couple of reasons. 
Don’t get too technical about the purchase point, current market value is solid as it is. 

First off I don’t like this company in terms of a long term prospect, given the Covid sales bump combined with the vaccine news, but cases are worse then they’ve ever been. Essentially a 9/11 every couple of days.. So that’s good for this one I guess... but as I will probably explain every time, when I give these alerts I’m telling you the price will move upwards enough within the expiration date to exceed theta, but I don’t provide sell points. 

First thing first, the boys at Best Buy are doing a good old fashioned buyback this quarter, so that helps make things guaranteed. We are down well below short moving averages and at our five year moving averages for those of you that give a shit. 

The company has been performing exceptionally during quarantine and has a strong bottom line (Yes I know it went down a bit due to logistical costs of online sales). We will definitely see some positive growth over the next month or two, and it’s another clear example of a stock that is being majorly oversold post earnings. 

If you start typing under the impression I think BBY is going to fly to 125 in two weeks you’re a fucking idiot. Don’t bag hold dumb fucks, especially if you buy OTM calls. 

Don’t think writing puts is an awful strategy on this one either, but think CRM is still better, and you can soak up way more premium with its current IV and volume."

Malls have been quiet af on wsb bets and I ask you, WHY?

A lot of fear around the mall sector with COViD obviously but with 2021 growth projections and spending projections and with vaccines on the road maybe it’s time to take a look at this heavy hitter. It’s been the most hit of the big mall stocks ytd but oddly enough have the best books. Morningstar has them uncertain but extremely undervalued. Lots of insane price targets from current levels.

Big enough to backstop itself too and likely buyback a ton during recovery.

Tell me a better play on malls and I’ll do it. I’ll really do it.

128,The difference between an autist and a retard,115,k6onxs,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6onxs/the_difference_between_an_autist_and_a_retard/,26,"Although I haven't been here for long, I've started to notice a certain dichotomy between two different types of WSB users. On one hand, there are the retards, and on the other hand there are the autists. Mind you, both retards and autists can gain money, and both retards and autists can lose money. The difference lies in how they do it. 

The retards are the public face of WSB and its most vocal cohort. Mind you, I'm not looking down on retards. I've made plenty of trades that can properly be described as ""retarted"" rather than autistic, like YOLOING my whole account on SPY puts and UXVY shares before the election. 

I've also learned quite a bit from the retards of this sub. The most important lesson has been not to be too uptight about money. After I blew up 70% of my account, my brain was telling me to get the hell out of the casino, but you all gave me the inspiration to pick up the pieces and YOLO them again. I've since recovered more than half of my Robinhood ""tuition."" 

But WSB's retards have also taught me what not to do. After NIO and PLTR rose precipitously most of November, many of you bought weeklies, and many of your portfolios (and the portfolios of your suggestible family members, coworkers, and friends) were decimated. It seems that buying calls at the peak of a long green run without any coherent thesis as to why the stock is still undervalued is not the way. ""Retard strength"" can move microcaps, but it can't move stocks with a float of more than a billion shares. Therein lies the difference between the retards and autists of WSB. 

The autists of WSB form their thesis before the run and before the retards have piled into their echo chamber. They might be early, but they are never late. There are a lot of super smart people on this sub, offering top-notch DD, but their voices are not always heard. Sometimes the memes come to life, and there's no longer any need to approach them rationally, but TSLA is the exception, not the norm. We've all been spoiled by the brilliance of its meme power, but that light can no longer lead us to Valhalla. We need to be smart, and put our faith in the true autists. 

There will always be the FDs that go up 5000% and the AAs that go up 600% when we meant to buy calls on AAL, but the law of averages dictates that the retards will lose. I may be a retard, and I have certainly lost, but I'm trying to turn it around. Who's with me?"

134,FEAC (DraftKing guys) and why it’s good for a short-term 30% return.,23,k6wimt,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6wimt/feac_draftking_guys_and_why_its_good_for_a/,14,"FEAC is a SPAC being used to send the company Skillz Inc public. A SPAC, In short, is a company that forms for the sole purpose of bringing another company public. The company backing this SPAC is no other than the same which backed Draftkings (Flying Eagle). Flying Eagle’s CEO is Harry Sloan. He has been in the business a long time. He was a founding investor and board member of a company you might have heard of - Bethesda Games. So either he has a great eye for this or he is super lucky - Time will tell. 

Skillz is an online mobile multiplayer competition platform that helps developers monetize their games. You likely haven’t heard of most of the games Skillz’s represents, but your grandma probably has. They are: Solitaire Cube, Blackout Bingo, Pool Payday, 21 Blitz and more. All of these are listed on the Apple and Android App Store. All highly rated and with thousands of reviews. The thing that makes them unique vs. other games is that you can 100% legally gamble in them. They accept PayPal and most major credit cards. All withdrawals of winnings can go straight to your bank account. How they managed to get this pass both major App Stores and the US gov I can’t seem to figure out. 

Noteworthy Facts:
1. Forbes named it on its list of the next “Billion dollar start ups”. CNBC named Skillz the “global leader in eSports”. 
2. Skillz players averages 65 min per day. To put in perspective, Netflix only averages 50 min per day, per user. 
3. They expect user growth to get into the “hundreds of millions within the next two years”. 
4. 10 different SPACS tried to bag Skillz IPO, but they decided to pick Flying Eagle because of Harry Slone’s success. 
5. Financials: Third Quarter Revenue of $60 Million (Up 92% Year-over-Year), Revenue for Year to Date of $162 Million, (Up 91% Over Prior Year). Full Year Revenue expected at $225 Million. 
6. Working towards being incorporated into Peleton bikes. 

Skillz checks the box on financials. The rest is up to interpretation. The important take aways for me here is that it’s backed by a guy with a great eye for gaming and a company that has somehow added gambling to these games. I also am seeing little talk about it on stock forms (only 2 posts on WSB in the last 3 months) and the general media for a company that is getting high marks from some major hitters like Forbes and CNBC. It’s been on a steady rise since it officially announced its IPO on Monday, so don’t expect a 100% return, but it’s in no way done. 2 rocket ship emojis 

Positions: $50k stock. 
Selling 50% at $20, 25% at $22 and holding 25% long term."

140,$GME is a SCREAMING buy. But AFTER earnings…..,21,k6y0zu,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6y0zu/gme_is_a_screaming_buy_but_after_earnings/,108,"Obviously, $GME Q4 results are a day of reckoning for this business. I have long been tracking this company but I only recently got in with some skin in the game (disclosure – I own \~3000 shares; I am also new to WSB:)). I also think Q3 is an important moment for the company given the institutional dynamics, but **I do NOT think holding through 12/8 would be a good gamble** (which is why you are seeing several people sell their shares to buy in later). Instead, I think there is a better way to play earnings on 12/8.

First off, as everyone knows, Q3 results are going to be ugly. Some have made the argument that the market has already priced this in, but this is only partially true. **Market pricing is dictated by both event-driven probability and hype.** I would guess that the probability of GME missing consensus estimates is \~50/50 (note missing consensus estimates is different from negative growth which is guaranteed in this case). Nobody knows where things will shake out, so the market will price it as such. However, there is a tremendous amount of hype around this stock (for good reason in my humble opinion), which is why I think this stock is trading well heading into an earnings announcement for a turbulent quarter.

Now, **one way to estimate performance is by using credit card activity as a proxy for performance**. We can then use this and compare it to consensus estimates by research analysts:

*Same-Store Sales*

* Telsey: -27.0% (as of 12/2/20)
* Wedbush: -20.0% (as of 12/4/20)

**If you look at credit card data scrapping services, it looks like the quarter will end down around 25 – 30%** (based on the service you use). Obviously this is close to the Telsey number, but its worth noting that these credit card services slightly overestimated performance in Q2 (so the number will likely be closer to -30%). **Therefore, I have a feeling that this stock is going to sell-off significantly**, **making it a much better entry point versus pre-earnings.**

**Personally, I am still long this stock, but it seems like the stock is going to drop in the immediate aftermath of the earnings release, which is why I will be holding off from buying on Monday. I’m definitely going to scoop up some more after earnings however!**

143,Next Major Position,47,k6sh0b,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6sh0b/next_major_position/,29," 

Well well well, its that time of year for me to write a DD post for the 50 odd people that will see it and the 2 people that will actually read this fuckin thing but here goes. Boomer stocks; especially AT&t and GE, are generally looked down on by this forum and for good reason. I took a look at Stocktwits and when AT&T moved up 1 FUCKING percent, people were freaking out, acting as if the messiah had returned or some bullshit. Well, I have reason to believe it's going to move a lot more than just 1 percent over the next month.

First: Potential Price Upgrade?

Currently, Morningstar has a price target of $37 per share, a very nice increase from the current stock price. This is primarily because of Time Warner's willingness to move forwards and keep releasing movies (Some pretty big names such as Godzilla, Mortal Combat, and the Conjuring), even with the Vurus shutting down theaters across the country. Also, AT&T is bidding out DirectTV (even at a potential loss), freeing up its assets for better opportunities.

Second: Technicals:

I will link another post with some technical voodoo in it, but they look good according to my crayon vision. Again, within the next year this could easily hit $37 per share, considering this still has not fully recovered from the crash of March.

This is the major reason as to why I am very interested in this stock. Also, because of the incredibly low IV, options are cheap as hell currently, even ITM monthlys.

Finally, if you want to look at my track record, my two major plays this year was a certain vaccine company (Ticker is banned) back in March, managed to make quite a nice amount off of them when the stock went from my buy in at a little over a dollar to my sale of $6 per share, and my latest play was 369 APHA $17.5 Jan 15 calls which printed like mofos. (You can see my shitty dd on these in past posts).

Anyways, I am not a financial consultant and if you buy anything, do it on your own accord please!

Position (Relatively small): 40 $T $30C Jan 15/21

I also have 100 shares of GME currently."

Thanks to a catchy ticker, they shot up to \~$32 this week. This of course is retarded. As we all know, our lord and savior Elon Musk hates lidar, and I'm betting this fucker is primed to crater harder than Nikola.

Now when GMHI announced the deal, they were valuing Luminar at roughly $3.5 billion dollars, a bat shit crazy number for a company expecting to do $15 million in revenue this year, and $26 million the next. The market quite understandably knew this was a shit deal, and the stock sat pretty much at NAV forever. Yet today, that company pulling in a cool $15 million is ""worth"" over $10 billion.

Next take a look at Velodyne Lidar, a larger, significantly more established competitor who also briefly topped out at $32 a share, and is now hanging out at just over $15. They were only valued at $1.6 billion in their SPAC deal, and are expecting just over $100 million in revenue this year. 

If you need another reason to buy puts, the paint chip eating wizard of Wallstreet Jim Cramer thinks its a bargain at this price.

Also sorry this is after market close, took me forever to get reasonable fill prices.

I make good money, and have $100k or so that I play with in E*Trade.

I want to start losing everything on Options, but have some questions to make sure I do it as efficiently as possible:

How liquid are ITM options?

If I pick up some TSLA 12/31 $600c, and the stock touches $625, how quickly would I be able to dump the contracts?
is it as quick as with shares?

If I buy $600c contracts, but the price goes down, I’m out only the premium I paid right?
Conversely, if I buy $600p and the price goes up, I’m only out the premium?

It’s only if I “write” contracts that I’m obligated to buy or sell those shares.

Also, I seem to catch on to what you guys are suggesting a little late. I am usually looking at buying into whatever your talking about while it’s near the top (PLTR @ $27.60) What keywords should I be looking for in your retarded posts that will clue me in to what is going to happen before it starts moving?

I’ve been a lurker of this subreddit for a few years now and always enjoyed the content, the shitposts, the memes, and the rare DD’s. But this week, I’ve feeling for my fellow retards, especially those that gambled their 401k’s and Holographic Charizard Pokemon cards on $PLTR. Orders on $ROPE seem to be up BIGLY 🚀 over the past week, so I wanted to offer a bit of DD on an industry that you and your Netflix and Chill partner have become well acquainted with this year being stuck at home. At the very least, you owe it to your hand to hear me out about Cinemark ($CNK).

TLDR: $CNK 15 Jan 22, 20 Strike Bought Calls / $CNK 19 Mar 21, 12.5 Strike Sold Puts

So quickly, just to get this out of the way: I am a curator of shit. I originally started this reddit account several years ago because I got tired of playing shitty Super Mario Maker levels and had finally decided to make my own. Then, a year later, I was on a Pokemon kick and was desperately looking to trade Pokemon on my 3ds. It’s where I learned to sift through shitty trades and allowed my autism to truly flourish. You ever need a 5 IV hacked Japanese Ditto to get a perfectly spec’d egg? Do you have any idea what the hell I’m talking about? No, probably not. But I bring this up because when you’re willing look into the details so much for a fucking Pokemon, it only makes sense to use that same treatment for a financial investment. And just like Super Mario Maker, I got tired of seeing shitty trades and wanted to do something myself. So I went and studied markets and options the past four years and will likely try and make a career out of finance now.

But you’re here to learn about Cinemark. And here’s what you already know: Movie theaters have been absolutely crippled by Covid. That’s no secret. And just when vaccine news helps to get the likes of CNK and AMC back on their feet a bit, Warner Bros comes out yesterday and says they are moving all of their films to HBO Max. This announcement alone sent movie stocks tumbling as much as 20%.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/warner-bros-to-release-movies-on-hbo-max-threatening-theatrical-windows.html)

To add insult to injury, AMC had already announced ANOTHER 200 million shares in a public stock offering THAT MORNING to raise money, with their CEO going on to threaten investors that AMC will go bankrupt without help. This probably isn’t the first time you’ve heard of a possible AMC bankruptcy either, especially if you’re a subscriber to this very subreddit.

[https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/amc-stock-why-amc-entertainment-shares-sunk-16-today/)

And here is where I’m gonna start throwing some numbers at you. Because as awful as it is to threaten investors with the fear of bankruptcy, the reality is that AMC is in SERIOUS financial trouble. Pulled from TD Ameritrade, here’s a few numbers for you from their balance sheet (as of their earnings in Q3 2020):

Assets:

Cash/Cash Equivalents: $506 million

Total Current Assets: $609 Million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $6,808 million

Total Assets: $10,876 million

Liabilities:

Current Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $1,057 million

Total Current Liabilities: $1,588 million

Total Debt: $5,919 million

Total Liabilities: $13,246 million

So I know what you’re thinking: TLDR, StOp NuMbErs GiVe PoSiTiOnS ReTaRd. And I’ll get there, just like George R.R. Martin is getting to the end of the Game of Thrones series. But what is really important to see here is that for the CURRENT period that ends in one year, AMC has a deficit of $979 million ($1,588 million in current liabilities minus $609 million in current assets). And normally, when in such a situation, you generally have three solutions: go offer more stock; go sell some of your company; or, you take out loans with a creditor. AMC is doing the former with a stock offering. But why not go to a creditor and get a loan? Well, maybe it’s because YTD for Q1, Q2, and Q3, AMC has already drawn down a shit town of debt out just to cover their ass. Creditors likely will not be willing to finance this sinking ship much longer and AMC are in legitimate trouble.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amc-could-run-out-of-cash-by-then-end-of-2020-company-warns.html)

So this brings me to Cinemark and their balance sheet. And it’s here I’ll give you a few more numbers from their Q3 2020 Balance Sheet:

Assets:

Cash/Equivalents: $826 million

Total Current Assets: $984 million

Prop./Plant/Equip, Net: $2,832 million

Total Assets: $5,803 million

Liabilities:

Accounts Payable/Accrued Expenses: $599 million

Total Current Liabilities: $624 million

Total Debt: $2,519 million

Total Liabilities: $4,796 million

So I’d like to immediately draw your attention to the current period for CNK. Due to their stronger cash position (which in fairness, has been due to financing this year as well), they have a net surplus of $360 million for the next 12 months. What’s more, they can cover ALL of their current liabilities with their cash position alone for the next year. This is to say that if you believe that the Covid will be behind us within a year and that movie theaters will at least by open back to full capacity, Cinemark has the financial strength to survive another year without any sales.

The next thing I’d like to bring to your attention is the SIZE of both companies. If you look at the Prop./Plant/Equipment for AMC and CNK, you’ll see that

AMC has $6,808 million in assets

CNK has $2,832 million in assets

AMC is the largest movie theater company in the world, and here, it shows. They are over twice the size of Cinemark in property alone, and their total assets are just over twice the value of Cinemark’s as well. So AMC does have quite a bit of market share on the movie theater industry. However, with AMC’s financial weakness and a looming threat of bankruptcy, here are some possible outcomes:

1. AMC goes bankrupt. They will have to reorganize their corporate structure and will likely lose some of their theaters along the way. Competitors may have the option to buy some of these theaters and AMC loses some of their market share which could be beneficial for CNK.
2. AMC looks to merge. This is true for the larger market as a whole, but with belabored businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions look to be a huge market in the upcoming year. And while Cinemark doesn’t have the financial strength, on paper, to take on the massive debts the AMC currently holds, there is something to consider here in the numbers. If AMC is twice the size of Cinemark, Cinemark’s market share would increase by 3x on an outright acquisition of AMC (and that’s assuming they took on their debts as they stand today). Cinemark would more than double their debt in doing so, but CNK has also shown that they can manage their book better. They may see the added market share as a warrantable risk to take on.
3. AMC gets the funding it needs and survives in the short term. Cinemark isn’t really affected by this outcome.

Next, let’s consider the technicals of Cinemark. Cinemark was trading just above $30 before the great stock market fall back in March. It was trading as low as $5.71 at it’s lowest, and outside a one month period from the end of September to November 9th(vaccine news day), CNK was trading in a price channel that bottomed out around $10. With positive vaccine news and a rollout of vaccinations, it is likely that CNK will be able to open its doors again in the next six months. As such, there is a case to be made for CNK not breaking a fairly strong level of support moving forward.

The last part, admittedly, is a bit of my own opinion. But since the election and Pfizer/Moderna’s vaccine news, there has been a large shift in money across the markets. Specifically, money in the NASDAQ (Covid-proof) tech sector moved outwards towards other sectors, including stocks that were rightfully battered due to Covid. Retail, energy, and entertainment all saw large boosts with Covid relief. You don’t have to look much farther than stocks like Kohl’s (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Airlines (any of them), or cruise lines, all while watching tech largely stagnate (except for beloved meme stocks like Tesla and AMD, of course). Many of these are still trading below their pre-covid highs, and it is where I personally believe large, institutional money is moving and holding large portions of money. Sure, Covid cases are spiking at the moment and there is an argument to be made for the NASDAQ taking up arms again. But the stock market is a forward looking instrument and is now looking ahead to a point in time when Covid has been dealt with.

So to bring this all full circle, here is my TLDR for why Cinemark is a stock you should seriously consider looking into:

1. It has the financial strength to survive for at least another year, well past the point of covid vaccinations and a return to normalcy.
2. With AMC on the ropes, CNK could stand to benefit from an increase in market share if AMC does file bankruptcy. They could even pick up existing AMC theaters for significantly cheaper if such a corporate AMC structure were to occur.
3. While still trading below its pre-Covid highs (and for veritable reason), vaccine news and actual vaccinations only stand to help stocks in the entertainment sector (barring a failed vaccine, of course). And while Covid cases are certainly rising in the short term, because CNK has the financial backing to weather another year, it is a short term headwind that will likely be overtaken when vaccinations ramp up.

Positions? TLDR? Give yourself a year on this one. Buy a leap and leave it for a while. If you hate getting cucked by Theta decay, maybe sell some 10 or 12.5 strike OTM puts. That way, if you end up getting put shares, it’s of a stock you wanted long term anyway (and you got paid to get put into it). Premiums for such a volatile industry and very high right now and there is good money to be made in Theta and Vega.

CNK 15 Jan 2022 20 Bought Call: 4.00 (as of this writing)

CNK 19 March 2021 12.5 Sold Put: 2.40 (as of this writing). With a breakeven of 10.10, this puts you just above support if you do get put. If Cinemark is trading above $12.50 in 3 months time, this is a 19.2% ROI (or 6.4% a month), which is still a hell of a return (especially if you believe in the stock long term, like I do).

Since the dip it has recovered to ~2.30. I believe in the next few weeks that this stock will not only make a huge recovery but next year I believe this stock will return to ATH. My reasoning behind this is that rolls royce makes a shitload of airline engines, obviously covid fucked traveling and hence maintenance and purchases of new jet engines. If you look at the 1 year chart you can see that this stock hasn't recovered at all since March and has been consistently dropping. I believe this company has been overlooked for so long because of the low share price and inability to trade options on them. This stock should make a steep recovery to the $5-$10 range in the coming year once travel has been brought back to normal levels. This isn't alot but think of it like this for every $2 you put in out comes $5 to $10, seems like a great trade right? Well it is, so load up on as many shares as you can and once the share prices get back to normal you can sell options to all the other autists hopping on the Rolls Royce train. Oh, a little tip for the ones who read this whole thing hopefully in the following quarters we will get a phatass dividend payout like before and you can DRIP it into your current position causing a snowball effect on your new shiny investment.

Some.background: I am a software engineer. I don't work at Palantir. This is all based on my own prior knowledge and things I have read in one of their user guides.

Here it goes.

Pretend I'm the NSA. I have many databases, containing things like ISP data, security footage, text messages, GPS data, voice recordings, credit card transactions, emails, public records, and satellite images. I need a way to connect my datasets to generate insight, which in the case of the NSA means spying on someone.

Palantir sells the software to do that. It works in multiple steps.

1) It uses my datasets to create a knowledge graph where the nodes are all people, places and things in the ""universe"" and the edges indicate their relationship. It's like a social network, but in addition to connections to my friends, family, and coworkers, there is also an edge connecting me to my phone, my home, my car, my preferred Wendy's, etc.

2) Using the connections in that knowledge graph, it can create a coherent and complete timeline for a given person by piecing together data points from my whole data ecosystem. This requires machine learning and AI to extract signal from unstructured data like images and text, and the use of pattern matching to de-annonymize data by linking it back to specific people.

The end result: Reconstructing a model of the past by connecting all data breadcrumbs left along the way, and then predicting the future based on past events."

I haven’t seen this anywhere, so I would like to call your attention to a few recent job announcements from our friends at your and my new favorite Texas Corporation: GameStop (fuck off, Whataburger). 

Since **mid-November**—and right after RC sent his soon to be legendary letter to the Board—GameStop posted some mighty interesting job announcements for its Grapevine HQs. Especially for a Dying-Brick-and-Mortar-90s-Mall-Bro-Boomer company. 

It definitely seems like this Blockbuster redux is TOTALLY uninterested in pivoting to e-commerce, digital monetization, and a technologically-driven marketing infrastructure and product distribution landscape. 

Just find ‘em in the mall.

Or else you bears are just fucking stupid and cant read or understand words good.

But you don’t have to take my word for it. Do the clickity clickity and the read-y read-y. 

I think you’ll find it just as odd as I do that a soon-to-be-bankrupt boomer company just published a bunch of silicon-valley-jargon-filled-digital-monetization-bla bla jobs right before everyone is wondering if they’re going to pivot away from being Another Cautionary Tale and toward a Fuck Yeah E-commerce-centric Money Minting Technology-driven Gaming Company You’re Gonna Tell Your Goddamn Grandkids About When You’re Old and Rich (and hopefully fulfilled spiritually and emotionally after many kind and generous years of philanthropy and a lot of self-care and reflection)

Check out some of the highlights below. Or don’t. I don’t give a shit. But GTFO of here with any kind of tHis StOcK iS BlOckBusTeR comparisons any more you simps. 

Was planning to sell a bit before earnings to buy back after the possible dip. I’m now seeing that as an unacceptably risky investment strategy in this particular instance.

We’re coming for you, Melvin. Tick Tock.

Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let’s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.

The [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)

The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.

Here is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter. 

The [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.

While yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.

Also, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million

Meanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis. This is great news for companies like Nvidia, QCOM, AVGO and many more.

Moving on to the auto sector the US light vehicle sales [forecast](https://ibb.co/THKtD9y) has seen an improved outlook for next year, up around 10% from 2020 at around 15.6 million with US [EV SALES](https://ibb.co/Hdk0qqq) increasing over 70% next year, this could be a huge boost to Tesla and other EV ramping up players like GM and FORD.

This is great news for Tesla after a big bear on the company just [trimmed](https://ibb.co/25tcFhJ) his short position on TESLA

[Lemonade](https://ibb.co/wLqdKCS) had a big jump yesterday after the Motley Fool [published](https://ibb.co/PrJVJ5G) a long pitch for this company. I also own this stock and I believe it can become a very big player in the insurance business in the future. At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them. But don’t just rush today in the stock because it spiked 20%, wait for it to cool off, maybe dollar cost average on it.

While I am very interested to see what Disney [announces](https://ibb.co/hZDjxwk) next week as they may give new information on how the streaming business is doing and what the plans for the company are looking forward as 30% of the revenues of the company came from parks in the last years. I don’t think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.

A couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts. While they also offered [guidance](https://ibb.co/34Hfnsz) for next quarter of around $404M to $408M also better than consensus at $387M as the stock is up 5% pre-market. 

While Marvell [missed](https://ibb.co/nCx5nHF) on expectations as the company cited supply issues constraints that are limiting the capability to satisfy demand. 

Bad [news](https://ibb.co/yWJz3Kg) also came in for AMC with Warner’s decision to send all they’re 2021 movies directly to streaming on the same day as the theatrical release. This combined with the fact that AMC is filling to sell around [200M shares](https://ibb.co/Lkjkt5G), makes me think that this company is going to have the same route as Hertz. The cinema business wasn’t doing so great since 2017, and this might be the final blow for the industry.

And one final thought, it might be a good opportunity to get long on Dave & Busters, Chewy, Adobe and Lululemon for next week, as I think they are all poised for good quarterly results. So, I will give all of them a small allocation today as I think there might be some good upside here in a few days, as there is a lot of money still on the sidelines with the most recent AAII asset [survey](https://ibb.co/7SRKkzk) showing that investors have more than 18% in cash on hands that can be pumped in the stock market.

They did this after Cohen's letter and less than a week from Q3, where we are expecting an answer to Cohen's complaints and a stellar guidance that pulls GME away from their old brick-and-mortar business strategy and turns it into a versatile e-commerce powerhouse.

And if we look at the cute coloured crayons and lines, there's a textbook cup and handle forming on the daily chart.

pricing on these options started making sense yesterday and I loaded up on calls. You have possibly upward sloping call delta for returns that are 50%+. While this is pricey, it is where options were when PLTR was about 20 bucks last time. This tells me selling pressure is near exhaustion.

As other people have mentioned, we have hit the long term trend line and have bounced off of that. I see one more retest of the trend line before we go back up. ~~Now we haven't hit the 38% retracement level of 32, which is around 20. So there is a chance we may go down to 20 before going back up~~. (Thanks  [brandimore](https://www.reddit.com/user/jbrandimore/)). We have hit the 38 retracement level at 22, which is also the long term trend support. So the risk ~~retard~~ reward is quite attractive now.

I see a move into near 38-42 by the end of the year. We saw similar moves by Nio and Tesla in the earlier part of their large 10x run-ups. I think there is a high likelihood the run-up for PLTR is only beginning. Based on sentiments on WSB, i see another 3-7 days of consolidation around 22-25 to shake out the week hands as well as burn off the 12/4 and 12/11 options before we will see a continuation of the upward trend.

> Based on our analytics, we anticipate a total addressable market (TAM) of nearly $300 billion by the year 2024. In addition to this TAM, we also see opportunities beyond silicon in areas like software and services.

The memes and kiddy investors think Intel is going down so the IV is low and premiums are at a good price. The bears are always wrong about tech stocks. They think intel is some kind of shitty company that doesn't have the worlds leading market movers invested in their success, I dont know maybe I'm wrong about their thoughts. I can't read their minds but I can read Intels press releases and figures.

News like this about AI, maybe it's not gaming performance but that's not what we are here to talk about:

> Intel Announces Unmatched AI and Analytics Platform with New Processor, Memory, Storage and FPGA Solutions

https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-announces-unmatched-ai-analytics-platform-new-processor-memory-storage-fpga/#gs.n7nrs7

> Why It’s Important: AI and analytics open new opportunities for customers across a broad range of industries, including finance, healthcare, industrial, telecom and transportation. IDC predicts that by 2021, 75% of commercial enterprise apps will use AI1. And by 2025, IDC estimates that roughly a quarter of all data generated will be created in real time, with various internet of things (IoT) devices creating 95% of that volume growth2.

They have their hands in Machine Learning, AI, neuroscience and self driving cars...

> Spotlight: Big Bets
> To be at the forefront of the constant technological change in our industry, we must evaluate new and existing big bets based on the following criteria: the “bet” is leading the edge of a technology inflection, it plays a significant role in our customers’ success, and it offers a clear path to profitability and attractive returns. Our current big bets are memory, autonomous driving, and 5G.

I don't see any reason to logically remain skeptical of Intels consistent year to year performance and market adaptations.

INTC leaps to the moon

Enjoy the new car or house.

Here are the necessary edits I had to include in the post that are responses to trolls, if anyone wants more info and meme defense: 

Edit because trolls:

Look at the greeks of the contract if you know how to read them. They are good for this strike price. 

It is a safe and profitable bet with the delta and vega ratings. A 10% increase in the underlying would put it past strike price and net several hundred % return on investment. 

I'm sorry if I'm ""casting pearls before swine"" and this is all going everyone's heads like my [$6 ITM PLTR calls I posted last month.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jh2njz/get_in_on_this_while_you_can_pltr_6_itm_call_you/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) But let's stop playing dumb ok? Let's make money.

Also: because so many people say ""AMD BEat IntEl hurrdprorpdr"" ... The success of AMD in PC gaming doesnt negate Intel's success everywhere else:

> At Intel, our strategy is to deliver the world’s best semiconductors for an increasingly data-centric world. Over the last few years, we’ve initiated a transition from being a PC-centric company to a data-centric one and expanded our product offerings in order to seize new market opportunities.

I am a die-hard Unity fan & was obsessed for weeks leading up to the IPO to make sure I got in at first chance. This wasn't intended to be a swing trade for me, in fact this stock is the only reason I ever started investing at all & was the first trading I ever did, but I got fired two months ago & haven't found a new gig yet & I was able to sell most of my shares this morning to pay my rent :)

I do plan on reinvesting, but for now I just wanna say- thanks stonks, u rly do be goin up.

Love y'all stay retarded.

p.s. If you don't know, Robinhood will actually write & mail a check for you, in case your rental company is also still living in the forking 90s and make you mail a check to Florida.

Digital Foundry: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QR9bj951UM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QR9bj951UM)

Ranked #4 for average benchmark on UserBenchmarks: [https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/)

AMD seems like they have significantly improved their product line-up compared to the Radeon 5000 Series. AMD's value proposition for as a unified CPU and GPU manufacturer seems to have worked with last gen and current gen game consoles, as both Sony and Microsoft have opted for the same silicon. PC Users may also be attracted by the unified components value proposition and translate to higher PC CPU and GPU sales as AMD has filled the gap with both INTC and NVDA.

Depending on how many GPUs AMD keeps in stock and the actual demand for new GPUs in 2021, I think the 6000 Series could chip away at NVDA's strong lead in market share for GPUs like with Intel CPUs. In doing so, this may attract investors away from NVDA, like with INTC, and boost AMD's stock significantly.

IF (big if) AMD's next CPU/GPU line-up is to overtake NVDA next year, they could easily become the next $500B semi-conductor company in a few years. 

Now, what do the autists of WSB think? Can Lisa Su do it? Discuss 

Position: 2/19/2021 $95 C. Might add $100 1/21/2022 C and a round lot on a dip, as the FDA's approval for the PFE vaccine may lead to another sector wide dip in tech stocks.

* ZUO is a SaaS company like PLTR and enables subscription commerce for companies who want to transition their businesses from traditional one time transactions to Netflix-like recurring subscriptions.
* Recurring subscription are valued much higher by boomer shareholders (# PLTR), making ZUO an attractive play for every major company on the planet
* ZUO already transact $12B+ of annual subscriptions with massive growth rates
* Unlike PLTR, ZUO has been trading sideways since IPO two years ago and is currently near all time lows. Absolute bargain and can only go up from here! Very cheaply valued compared to nearly all other SaaS companies.

* **Just released an earnings and forecast beat, sending shares up 5.7% premarket. Closed biggest deal in history this quarter. Will keep beating earnings from here according to industry trend.**
* ZUO benefits from the global digitisation trend, which has been accelerated by the pandemic and is expected to further take-off in 2021. Most enterprise companies (massive total addressable market) are very early in their journey, but will eventually transition to recurring subscriptions which ZUO is uniquely positioned to support

They purchased Boost Mobile in July for 1.4 Billion with 9 million customers. They have said they're making progress on moving into the wireless field as a ""disruptor"" but many are beginning to skepticism.

1. Cup and handle pattern = stock will moon. Don't ask me why, apparently it's a thing.
2. We're pretty far above the moving average (purple line), which shows great strength in the imminent rebound
3. We've tested the support several times (meaning the stock price touches the purple line but doesn't go below) and we passed the test (meaning peeps have confidence stocks won't tank)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2xnd7lpyd2361.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=64b7a3e4dbadf4d4b1acb713969c3b4ea66be650

4. Short interest currently at 137%, meaning people shorted many more stocks than there are actual stocks to buy back. This number, 137%, is very significant and unheard of. Meaning when the stocks keep rising, all those who shorted the stock have to fight that much harder to buy shares back to cover their shorts, leading to a short squeeze. [https://www.highshortinterest.com/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)

&#x200B;

5. No, the short squeeze isn't ""over"". If you look at the volume of shares shorted, it's literally increasing. If the shorts are covering their position, you'd see a lower volume of shares shorted. Why are they shorting more instead of just buying back? They short to drive prices down to cause people to panic and sell, which drives prices more down, so they can cover their short position and buy back cheap shares from all the paper hand retail investors. They have confidence we will fold and sell, and judging from all the paper hands selling PLTR from just a single Citron report, maybe they're right.

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)

&#x200B;

6. I've spent like 15 minutes learning and I see this much. You can bet the shorters, who know so much more than me, aren't sleeping at night these days. And you can bet there are whale longs out there trying to start this squeeze as well. We're just shrimp for the ride, as another autist had said in a comment somewhere else. This is a perfect short squeeze set up. Everyone knows this. This WILL happen.

&#x200B;

My 4 shares gonna moon.

&#x200B;

TL;DR = just another GME mooning post, but hopefully explained in a more noob way, cuz im noob  
TLDRTLDR =   🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀



Bonus edit: maybe some of you are wondering how to play the short squeeze. I spent a whole five minutes researching, and found out there's this thing called ""days to cover"", which is some number that's calculated by smart people, and it tells you the average number of days in order for all the shorts to be able to cover their position. Last time I checked the days to cover for gme is like 5.7 ish, which means the shorts will need to spend at least 5.7 days of buying stocks in order to buy back enough to cover their shorts, based on current average stock movement volume. 

What does this mean? It means the prices will be going up for days before the peak. Meaning if you sell within the first day of the squeeze, you'll regret it, but also your sale will contribute to stunting the growth of the mooning stock peen, so shame on you for selling within the first day. Hold for a couple of days and see triple digits hopefully.

And no, I was lying that I had 4 shares. I actually have 20, bought at $19, the most autistic entry point possible because I'm an expert. The 4 is symbolic of how fucking poor I am."

Instead, I’ve been looking at the correlation between **EEM** and the **DXY** and see a lot of potential for a big trade to close out the year. 

Just for some background:

**EEM (Emerging Markets Index)**: Consists of a basket of companies that are incorporated outside the US in developing nations – think China, India, Brazil, etc...

It’s top ten holdings are:

**DXY (Dollar Index):** A dollar weighted index that derives its value by weighing six different currency pairs against the dollar (USDX and DXY are the same thing):

USDX = 50.14348112 × EURUSD -0.576 × USDJPY 0.136 × GBPUSD -0.119 × USDCAD 0.091 × USDSEK 0.042 × USDCHF 0.036

It doesn’t perfectly capture the value of the US dollar, but for the purposes of this post, it’s good enough. 

**Thesis:** Based on historical data there is a clear negative correlation between the **EEM** and the **DXY**.

[30-Period Rolling Correlation of the Daily Price of EEM vs. DXY](https://preview.redd.it/lx2vo70wd5361.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e88b1e394bdcfab712dacf01eba1129af1b485)

Over the last \~15 years of price history, the correlation between the two indexes has been negative. There have been periods where the correlation reversed to the upside; however, those instances were rare and short-lived. Based on the data it's clear that the correlation is most negative succeeding the 2008 financial crisis with the introduction of QE and is sustained until 2012 when the **DXY** began to recover. There was also a short-lived negative correlation spike in 2016 (Donald Trump elected) and in 2018 (Trade War) - both the result of market volatility and a move out of equities and into USD. 

The **EEM** has never broken up above $55.00; however, given the massive headwind pushing the US dollar down, and the massive tailwind propelling nations like China, India, and others (or whatever), I'm willing to bet **EEM** breaks out above the $55.00 level in the next 3-6 months and pushes $60.00+ by the end of 2021.   

**Why:** A weaker dollar allows emerging market countries more freedom to provide fiscal stimulus without fearing negative implications for their own economies. For instance, an emerging market government might feel more comfortable with fiscal easing if its currency is rising, dampening the potential for an inflationary shock (there are other reasons, but I’m too lazy to list them all).

**Plan: EEM** is currently sitting at \~$50.80 as of this post, and the **DXY** is hovering around $0.9055. Based on some eyeballing “technical analysis”, it looks like the next level of support for the DXY is $0.8882. I’m also thinking that while stimulus might not happen this year, it’s basically guaranteed to happen in 2021. More stimulus should also help depress the US dollar. Also, the holidays are historically a good time for stocks and absent any (surprising) bad news, the market should melt up higher until Christmas. Lastly, the prices on EEM options are so cheap I’m fully erect even thinking about it.

A bunch of important-looking people in white shirts and charcoal suits line like bowling pins along the shiny surface of the table, rambling feverishly about pointless details of the upcoming deadline.

Pelosi - a little bored and bothered with the whole process - slips off her shiny, black heels underneath the grand table. She stretches - her back an arch, slender legs elegantly crossed, firmly pressed along the tight pantyhose of her thighs. None of the bowling pins turned to notice.

Suddenly, the corners of her blush-red lips curl into a sly smile. Her supple leg, like the flexible neck of a black swan, slowly extends into the darkness under the desk, unseen beneath the babbling nonsense of the talking heads around her.

Nudge. Her toes curl on McConnell's inner thigh. The lace of her pantyhose wrinkle against the smooth silk of McConnell's pants.

It was as if lightning jolted through McConnell's entire body, almost snapping his neck to look down at what intruded his sacred space.

First, a wave of confusion.

Then, realization hit.

He looks up, all of a sudden noticing the beautiful woman across the black ocean and pointless chatter. She was two armspans away, but to him he felt he could touch her. She was eighty years old, but to him she glowed like an immortal goddess. She was a Democrat, but to him that didn't matter anymore.

She then winked and did the blowie motion with her tongue in cheek.

Ten seconds of unspeakable thoughts flashed through his head and his tie felt too tight. Then, he shook his head, hard.

""No."" McConnell shuffled his chair backwards, no longer in reach of the swan under the desk.

“We just don’t have time to waste time.”

Airbnb intends to IPO at a price of $44-50 per share. At the $50 mark, that's a equity valuation of $35 billion. 

**Who TF is the Dean and why should we listen to what he says?**

His name is Aswath Damodaran who is finance professor at NYU and teaches corporate valuation among other things. Sometimes interviewed on CNBC to balance out the crazies. He always says he doesn't aim to time the market, but he did buy TSLA pretty much at the very bottom at $180 some time ago (I always regret not following his trade), although he did sell a bit later around the $600 mark (pre-split).

**Ok, tell me what he valued Airbnb at:**

About $36 billion or $54.41 per share (he takes into account options, warrants, RSUs etc)

**TL:DR**

Buying Airbnb at $54 is a fair price from a valuation perspective. The further below, the better the buy.

I think this is the wrong strategy. For those of you who may not know, when there is a dividend on a stock sold short, the short seller must pay it to the person they're borrowing from.

If management declares a dividend policy targeting 50% of future FCF, I believe GME stock would quickly appreciate to its Fair Market Value (FMV) on a DCF valuation model. If management also lays out a plan for the long term evolution of the company, that valuation model would rise significantly. But the dividend is what would convince the market of the fair value of GME shares.

Older scanners needed to do one ‘slice’ every 2 or 3 millimetres. Very slow. Large radiation dose. Largely phased out. Newer machines are ‘helical‘ scanners. Take pictures in a spiral, not slices. Much faster, much less radiation.

Current CAT scanners have software to enable 3D reconstruction of solid objects: like bones. The reconstructed image can then be rotated so you can ‘see’ what it looks like in 3D. As you can imagine, this ability is crucial in several medical / surgical specialties.

It is not clear if NNOX scans can do this. The presentation yesterday was not clear on this point. The scans are described as ‘tomograms’ which means slices, but not clear if 3D reconstruction possible AND THIS MATTERS.

The total radiation dose for a NNOX scan also matters, although unlikely an issue.

Have written to them. Bombard them with the question: does NNOX scan allow 3D reconstruction?

Edit: broke the golden rule: 127.78 shares at 57.8. There is another potential problem: NNOX business case is ‘pay per play’ I.e. pay per X-ray or scan, rather than outright sale of equipment. This is open to accusations of profiteering IF the costs are seen to be exploitative. They also make a HUGE claim that X-rays or scans will be interpreted by AI assisted by remote radiologists. Established radiologists are not going to like this one bit. Threatens their status at local level, ceding this to someone who might be less trained, willingly to work for peanuts, like a battery hen anywhere in the world. "

If you are not aware yet CAPE stands for cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio.

Now, taking a closer look at the chart you can see this ratio rally up during the roaring 20’s and then again even higher around the new millennium.  As we approach 2021 the ratio is approaching the height of the latter.

Why is this important?  If you draw a trend line across the two peaks you can see that the CAPE ratio and current rally still has a ton of upside left in it.

**VIRGIN GROUP'S ACQUISITION CORP**

This is my boy *Richard Branson's* SPAC and he is actively trying to get in on the EV hype. If this ticker turns out anything like his other love child, SPCE, we can pretty much count on a one-way trip to the moon. He's been on the EV hype train for quite a while and the current EV goldrush seems to have created the perfect storm. His SPAC had an initial public offering of $480,000,000.

""Virgin boss Richard Branson is about to go head-to-head with Tesla’s Elon Musk by adding an electric vehicle to the brand’s already extensive portfolio.

During an interview with Bloomberg TV, Branson said that he has a team working on developing an electric vehicle for the mass market, which would rival Tesla. This statement was released during the Formula E event in Miami. The billionaire said that Virgin might compete with Tesla in the electric car business in the future.

Virgin has already developed an electric car, which is currently competing in the electric version of the world's premiere racing competition Formula 1. Formula E uses a more defined and well-engineered electric motor similar to its counterparts in Formula 1.""

Now we all know the key to SPACs is to get in on the ground floor. Why? Because minimal risk, that's why. This SPAC is currently trading at the bargain price of 10.40 thanks to that lovely little market crash we had over the last couple of days.

**Which company is Branson's SPAC merging with?**

Speculation on speculation. The most prominent rumor floating around the SPACiverse is that they will be working with the company Envision.

Go check the website. They have their fingers in practically every part of the renewable energy sector.

I'm a little retarded so I have no idea if this SPAC has already been talked about on WSB, but it's only just getting picked up by the Youtube stock influencers. My game plan is to get in ""early"" before *all* the influencers pick it up.

Boy has it been an ugly 7 day bloodbath for BestBuy. The kind of red river flow that makes you second guess taking the dirt road home. But man have I been waiting for this moment.

*Currently $106.50 a share*

The answer is simple: buy, and buy fast.. and here is why:

1. Their Q3 sales were knock out. 22% increase from Q3’19 and 173.7% increase in online orders.

2. Their dividend was just increased to .55cents per share. (must own stock before 12/14. Dividend payout is early January.

3. JPMorgan just upped their price target from $115 to $124.

4. Their 3 month RSI is extremely low. Hovering around 31..the company is ridiculously oversold right now. 

5. Their market cap is $28B and they do $40B in revenue each year. TDAmeritrade has them marked extremely low with a P/E ratio of 15

6. The Holliday season is here and electronics are the new sliced bread. Within the next two weeks I can realistically see it running $8-10 higher.

7. I’m not sure about you, but the BestBuy where I live (Connecticut) is consistently packed. Good products, inventory and an established brand.

But I’ll leave it at that for now. Keeping the list at a lucky 7 in hopes for a Jackpot. Check out the chart and further your DD if this post sparked any curiosity. 

(Keep in mind I am extremely bias, for as I have my balls on the line with this. And 55 calls that expire in January.. So a decently high risk.. On a scale of “doesn’t make a difference if they expire - to - I’ll be hanging in the rafters” I’m probably like a “will be slightly depressed for a day or two, and gaze out the window with a melancholic stare while listening to All You Wanted by Michelle Branch.”

This time we got a  green hydrogen rocket being gased up by Fusion Fuel and it's taken us to green tendy town. Green  hydrogen batteries and green hydrogen products are riding the ev market,  the green energy market, tech market and this company has got it's fingers in globally and a big sister company who is facilitating growth.

(For the noobs: This is a SPAC merger, SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) are companies that investors and retail investors buy so that they can merge with a company and give them a large injection of cash and bring that company public. After merger all the stocks and warrants in the SPAC get transferred to the new company and that companies ticker replaces the SPACs. Most SPACs also have a legal guarntee that every share you buy is backed up to 10$ in the event that the merger doesn't go through. )

&#x200B;

Here is some DD from someone who actually likes reading the investor presentations.

&#x200B;

""Anyone holding HCCH has probably seen [their investor presentation](https://hlacquisitions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HL_FF-Investor-Presentation_6.23.20.pdf) by now.

What struck me throughout the presentation was the mention of MagP Inovação being an *exclusive partner* and their CPV solar trackers being exclusive to Fusion Fuel. What I haven't seen discussed on reddit yet is that [MagP Inovação and Fusion Fuel are owned by the same private company](https://keyfh.com/), KFH Investments.

The investor presentation states that ""MagP has **constructed**   and installed 20+ solar plants around the world, performing daily   tracker performance monitoring with 98% up-time over the past 10-years"".   A different section states that ""Fusion Fuel’s electrolyzer can attach   to CPV modules **already being produced**   by MagP Inovação"". Suddenly, it makes sense why Fusion Fuel's   electrolyzers are being built to specifically work with MagP's CPV   trackers. Clearly, there is some manufacturing expertise in place that   Fusion Fuel will benefit from when it comes time to build the   electrolyzers.

I also haven't seen  solar  irradiation levels discussed in the previous DDs, which are  paramount  to HCCH's play. Portugal and Spain have [the highest levels in Western Europe](https://i.imgur.com/7OsdREP.png). [Here is a detailed look at Portugal specifically](https://i.imgur.com/ZH8drpE.png). This is probably a huge stretch, but KFH also [own a 39 hectate winery](https://medeiroswines.com/en) in the [Moura region](https://i.imgur.com/wCon6rU.png),   which has near peak levels of normal irradiation in Portugal. Again,   probably a huge stretch and I have no idea what the price of land is in   Portugal, I just found this interesting from a synergy standpoint.

The Portugese government [plans to invest USD 7.3B in green hydrogen projects by 2030](https://renewablesnow.com/news/portuguese-govt-approves-national-hydrogen-policy-699832/).   That is great and all IMO, but ""New market development (e.g., North   America, MENA, Australia)"" being the first thing listed in the investor   presentation timeline (with a timeline of 0-1 years) is what attracted   me. Nikola [paid Nel ASA $30M](https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-orders-enough-electrolysis-equipment-from-nel-to-produce-40000-kgs-of-hydrogen-per-day-79)   this month for enough electrolyzers to power 5 of their planned  fueling  stations @ 8k kg/day. The last 3 slides of Fusion Fuel's  presentation  make some extremely bold claims about the CapEx costs of  their tech vs.  centralized electrylyzers. They claim \~$196 USD/kW vs.  \~$1,064 USD/Kw  for centralized electrolyzers. This is why I'm so  bullish right now.""

# Intel Advances Progress in Integrated Photonics for Data Centers

 **About the New Technology Building Blocks:** At the Intel Labs virtual event today, Intel demonstrated key progress in critical technology building blocks that are fundamental to the company’s integrated photonics research. These technology building blocks — including light generation, amplification, detection, modulation, complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) interface circuits and package integration — are essential to achieve integrated photonics. A prototype shown at the event featured tight coupling of photonics and CMOS technologies, serving as a proof-of-concept of future full integration of optical photonics with core compute silicon. Intel also showcased micro-ring modulators that are 1000x smaller than traditional components. The large size and cost of conventional silicon modulators have been a barrier to bringing optical technology onto server packages, which require the integration of hundreds of these devices. These combined results pave the way for the extended use of silicon photonics beyond the upper layers of the network to inside the server and onto future server packages. 

Intel technology building blocks showcased:

* **Micro-ring modulators:** Conventional silicon modulators take up too much area and are costly to place on IC packages. By developing micro-ring modulators, Intel has miniaturized the modulator by a factor of more than 1,000, thereby eliminating a key barrier to integrating silicon photonics onto a compute package.
* **All-silicon photodetector:** For decades, the industry has believed silicon has virtually no light detection capability in the 1.3-1.6um wavelength range. Intel showcased research that proves otherwise. Lower cost is one of the main benefits of this breakthrough.
* **Integrated semiconductor optical amplifier:** As the focus turns to reducing total power consumption, integrated semiconductor optical amplifiers are an indispensable technology, made possible with the same material used for the integrated laser.
* **Integrated multi-wavelength lasers:** Using a technique called wavelength division multiplexing, separate wavelengths can be used from the same laser to convey more data in the same beam of light. This enables additional data to be transmitted over a single fiber, increasing bandwidth density.
* **Integration:** By tightly integrating silicon photonics and CMOS silicon through advanced packaging techniques, we can gain three benefits: lower power, higher bandwidth and reduced pin count. Intel is the only company that has demonstrated integrated multi-wavelength lasers and semiconductor optical amplifiers, all-silicon photodetectors, and micro-ring modulators on a single technology platform tightly integrated with CMOS silicon. This research breakthrough paves the path for scaling integrated photonics.

They have issued stock to the tune of diluting there shares from 117M to 137M. Ohh wait, that's what they did last month. This month they are issuing 10 times as many - **200M SHARES**. Going to **337M Shares**!

[109M on 9/30](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/shares_outstanding) to 337 M is a 300% increase in stock. It's like owning 1/3 as much of a company as you did a couple months ago.

They know there price will tank as these sell off, they have to sell them as quickly as possible. This will push share prices down to the $2 level within the next two weeks. No investor wants this to happen to a company.

\[b\]Now wait, doesn't this just mean that the company will be bigger and more profitable?\[/b\]

No - A normal stock issue isn't that detrimental to a company, they issue stock, get more money, and use that money to improve the company. But in this case they are spending this money at a burn rate of [200M+ a Month](https://deadline.com/2020/10/amc-entertainment-3q-sales-at-119m-had-419m-in-cash-as-of-sept-30-plans-to-sell-more-stock-to-raise-cash-1234600263/)

They will raise 100M - 500M off of this stock sale, and burn through it in less then 3 months, being no better off then they were three months previous, no better product, same old theaters, nothing will change, but they will have spent all the money they raised paying debtors, rent, employees, utils.

\[b\]But isn't the bottom already here? They lost 16% today\[/b\]

I don't believe they have been able to sell many shares yet. It will take them a couple weeks to sell that many shares. Plus they have had other bad news today.

Warner Bros. says [Movie Theaters be Fucked](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/business/media/warner-brothers-movies-release-streaming.html)

\[b\]They have 6B in Debt\[/b\], they obviously can't get any more loans, otherwise they never would have issues a 200M shares. At their expected burn rate the last three months they must be almost out of cash.

Their expenses, loan payments, and rent payments are way to high to continue for 6 months of almost non existent movie attendance.

**Isn't moviegoing attendance turning around? - No.**

[Weekend movie sales are hovering around 11M](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/?ref_=bo_nb_hm_secondarytab) This is down from an average of 220M.

AMC holds about 72% of the market share, they get to keep about [50% of ticket sales](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/b23298d4-61c9-4028-9103-b652338c303f.html#AMC-20191231X10K_HTM_ITEM6SELECTEDFINANCIALDATA_712989), and concession sales top out at 50% of ticket sales, this gives them monthly income of $35M and they have 80% of their theaters open to get that much income, they have to pay utilities and employees at about 800 theaters in order to get that 45 Million.

Last year they had 40k employees (mostly part time) Even if they only need 1/3 of that number, at $14 an hour, at 30 hours a week average, that comes to 25M a month. Rent is 80M / Month, interest is at least $25M / Month

Even with the best possible cost cutting, even if their loans become interest free for a year, they will lose 150M a month until attendance is at 2019 levels.

\[b\]But won't the debtors renegotiate? Give them more loans?\[/b\]

Here is the rub. They have assets to cover a good portion of their debt. They have 2.7B in property. They also have 4.7B in lease right of use. This will cover a good portion of their debt. Debtors may be thinking that it is better to rip off the Band-Aid now, and resell the theaters and property, then to have them depreciate another year and have assets sold off to pay the rent at a 200M+ burn rate.

\[b\]They are poised for a bankruptcy, and this stock sale proves it.\[/b\]

We have seen another company slowly die through stock dilution sales in the movie sector- **MOVIEPASS.**

You might be asking: How does this help me - Buy Puts, sell calls, short shares, exit upward positions. All investors will be looking to escape this loser.

The stock has dropped 34.6% over the past three months through Wednesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.06% has gained 6.2%.

&#x200B;

Edit:

**Someone will just buy em, right?**

They were perfect for a buyout before issuing 200M shares (besides the 5.5B Debt), but no company will buy something so diluted until the price plummets to 1/3 of what it was.

It would cost a company 2 -3x what they would have spent last week to buy the same % of the company at current share prices.

This kills a merger/sale till the price is $1"

338,The Future Of Plastics,13,k6f062,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k6f062/the_future_of_plastics/,25,"Good Morning Degenerates,

&#x200B;

Welcome to today's History & Science Class. Today, we will be learning about plastics.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are renewably-derived polymers that are entirely biodegradable and compostable. As you may know, other polymers require industrial recycling to be broken down. Authentic tards may be familiar with the PHA firm Metabolix, now called Yield10 Bioscience, which sank millions of tendies a few years ago developing the same science. The market was not ready then - but now - This Is The Way.

If you haven't heard from the likes of Robert Downey Jr yet, then here's the present. We generate over 300 million metric tons of plastic - equal to the weight of the entire human population. You think electric cars and solar power are the only way to solve our problems and go green? Think again.

The PHA market is approximately 1% of the entire plastic market. The largest barrier for this emerging market is the cost of raw materials, and refinding said materials. With that, the inability to achieve economies of scales is the largest, and one of the only major restrictions on the market.

Now turn to Danimer Scientific. This company has been a leader in PHAs for years on years as a privately-run company. Now I'm only half-stupid so I'm not sure if any posts have been made about this, but the SPAC Live Oak Aquisition Corp ($LOAK) has a definitive merger agreement with Danimer Scientific, providing $200 million in equity of the $890 closing equity valuation. Danimer Scientific is anticipated to go public as early as the end of this year, or early 2021.

What's this? Too good to be true? You heard me right, bitch. You better steal every last dime from your wife's boyfriend's wallet, because this is the future. One's first thought might be, "" Well, if this failed before, who's to say it yields now?""

Hear ye, motherfucker. Think:

\-Green New Deal

\-Net-zero emissions and carbon neutrality

\-Global Paris Agreement

&#x200B;

Danimer already has deals with the likes of Coca-Cola, Columbia, and Nestle. With the current deals they have, they are already at capacity. The funding secured from the merger, private investors, etc. will provide the necessary funding to develop another factory. With the funding already secured, they are prepared to increase production capacity 10x by 2025, thus increasing scale and profitability. The company has only around 20 million in debt, and has the growth potential of fucking Apple or Tesla. I will pour my life savings into this just to prove that I am right. I'll see you on the other side bitches.

If you would like to read more about this rather than listen to me drunkenly ramble, this is one of the more concise sources I found: [https://danimerscientific.com/live-oak-danimer-transaction/](https://danimerscientific.com/live-oak-danimer-transaction/)

If you do any DD on PHAs you'll find Danimer right in the Top 5 of the global list. If you want to waste your tendies on PLTR and NIO calls I don't give a shit, but this is the future."

See his original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k380yz/squeeze_on_steel/.  

While US Steel will get its gains, I think an even better opportunity lies with Cleveland Cliffs (CLF).  Cleveland Cliffs is a company that previously specialized in making iron ore pellets.  In the past decade, they have had a market cap in excess of $14B, vs a market cap now of just under $5B.  However, they have recently been on a buying spree.  Cleveland Cliffs acquired AK Steel Holding Corporation in Mar-2020, a company operating 8 steel plants and 2 tube manufacturing plants.  AK Steel is a leading producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products.  They are also in the process of acquiring ArcelorMittal USA later in Q4 2020.  What does that give us?  A vertically integrated supply chain, baby!
 
As you can see in their 10Q, they’ve nearly tripled their revenue on a quarterly basis over the last year.  The one down side is their net income was fairly low due to high COGS.  This is where the vertically integrated supply chain comes in.  They will be able to take it from the mines to pellets to flat rolled steel and keep all those sweet profits to themselves.  The net margin has trended fairly well over time, with the exception of an odd year or two here and there (2014-2016... ouch!, and 2020).  It has always bounced back though to the 15-20% range.  Add to that the backdrop of steel prices rising ~17% in the last two months, and you have some very profitable quarters incoming.  Additionally, their current ratio is very good, so despite making acquisitions, they have maintained a rock-solid balance sheet, pun intended.  I think this could run up to low 30’s.  Look at what the steel industry does: overreacts to supply and demand.  I can smell the tendies already.

I'm back with a second post explaining option things.  I was overwhelmed by the positive feedback from the first post, which can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2a2j8/options_explained_a_quick_beginners_guide/).  Before proceeding, you need to have a fundamental understanding of the following topics (if you can answer these questions you're set):

* What is a call/put?
* What is the difference between Selling to Open and Buying to Open? Which has more inherent risk and why?
* What are At the Money/In the Money/Out of the Money for both calls and puts?
* What is intrinsic value?
* What is extrinsic value?

If you can't answer any of these please read the first post or simply Google/YouTube the things you do not understand.  If you are really struggling with any of them and you've tried these resources please don't hesitate to message me or ask your question in the comments of the first post.

In this post, we are going to cover:

* Credit vs. Debit
* Selling Covered Calls vs. Naked Calls
* Cost Basis
* Selling Cash Secured Puts
* Debit Spreads

Grab your phone, open up your brokerage, and follow along.  I encourage the consumption of bourbon on the rocks and the listening of Mac Miller during the reading of this post.

***Credit vs. Debit***

* Credit - any money that a trader **collects** as a result of selling an option.  For selling calls/puts, if the seller places an Ask and the order gets filled, they will be credited with the money, meaning that it will immediately be placed into your account.
* Debit - any money that a trader **pays** as a result of buying an option.  For buying calls/puts, if the buyer places a Bid and the order gets filled, they ill pay the money for that option, and now they own that option.

***Selling Covered Calls vs. Naked Calls***

Covered calls are an option strategy where the trader uses 100 shares of the underlying as collateral to sell calls.  The sold calls should be out of the money and always needs to be above the cost basis of the owned stock to avoid loss.  This is a safer strategy than selling naked calls (selling a call when you do NOT own 100 shares of the underlying) because if the price of the stock breaks through the strike price and the buyer exercises you will not realize an immediate loss by buying shares above the strike and selling them for the strike.  Lots of words, lets take a look.  I, again, am going to use $MSFT as an example.  This is only an example, any sentiment towards this stock expressed is solely hypothetical.

We're neutral to bearish on $MSFT and don't think there will be any significant price spikes in the underlying.  We'll look at selling naked calls first.  Below is the 12/31 options chain for $MSFT Calls.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3ogjfcs7iw261.jpg?width=885&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b2cc8b36f737034b0f1945b8b5f46d4e72bc8b2

We think $MSFT is going to trade sideways or decrease in value, so we are going to sell the 12/31 $220.0C.  You put in an ask for $4.05 and it is filled, so that $4.05 is technically immediately credited into your account.  Robinhood will not immediately show this in your account because it is an open contract but as the option price changes those changes will be reflected on your daily P/L chart.

* Best case scenario for you: $MSFT trades sideways or decreases in value, resulting in the option decreasing in value.  At any point when the option is under the price you paid for it you could Buy to Close the call and that would be your realized profit.  For example, on 12/15 $MSFT is trading at $200.0, the call is now worth $2.05, so you could buy to close your contract and your gain would be $4.05 - $2.05 = $2.00, or $200.
* Worst case scenario: You go to sleep in the evening, smiling because you think you made an easy $4.05, you've figured out how to beat the market.  BUT $MSFT announces that it has been contracted by NASA to put computers on the Moon.  $MSFT rockets up to $300.  The person that bought your calls decides to exercise, this means that you would have to BUY 100 shares of $MSFT at the current market price and sell them at the strike price, or $220.0. Your max loss would be \[($300 - $220) x 100\] - $405 = $7,595.0.  If the price went higher or you had more than 1 open contract you could see how this is insane risk.  THIS IS WHY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT SELLING NAKED CALLS.

Covered Calls - Now lets say we have 100 shares of $MSFT that we bought during a dip at $205.0.  We are bullish on the stock and are holding long but don't think that it will go to $220.0 from $214.0 so we sell the same call.  Again, the money is *credited* to the account.

* Best case scenario the stock finishes just below the strike on the expiration date and you can sell another call further out for more premium.  If the stock is at $219.0 on the day of expiration, you can just sell a $230.0 call further out and collect more premium.  You can continue this until you are assigned the stock.
* Worst case? The underlying goes through the strike to $225.  Your total gains for the trade would be \[($220.0 - $205.) x100\] + $405 = $1,905.0.  Now, if you hadn't sold the call you would have realized more gains if you sold the 100 shares at $225, but only by $95.  ***THE IMPORTANT PART IS THAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE 100 SHARES AS COLLATERAL YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THEM AT THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE.***

***Cost Basis***

* Cost basis is the price you paid for a stock minus any credit you have received for selling covered calls, receiving dividends, etc.  This is done at the single stock level.
* Example:
   * We buy 100 shares of $WSB at $100.0 per share
   * We Sell to Open an OTM Covered Call on $WSB for $1.00.
   * Our 50% profit trigger is hit, and we Buy to Close the contract at $.50.
   * Our new cost basis is ($100.0 - $.50 = $99.5)
   * We Sell to Open another OTM Covered Call on $WSB for $1.00, but this time we let it expire worthless.  Our new cost basis is ($99.5 - $1.0 = $98.5).

Cost Basis is important when selling covered calls because you should not sell covered calls for a strike price that is less than your cost basis.

* Example: Our cost basis on $WSB after a few CCs is now $90.0 and is trading at $110.0
* $WSB takes a little nose dive with the market and falls to $80.0.  If we sell an $85.0 CC for $1.00, we reduce our Cost Basis to $89.0, but if we are assigned, we realize a total loss of $400.0 if the stock finishes anywhere above the strike price and is exercised.

***Selling Cash Secured Puts***

The risk associated with selling naked puts is the same as selling naked calls, but reverse.  If you sell a put, the stock tanks, you are now obligated to buy from the owner of the option the stock on the higher price than market.  For example, you sell a $20 put, the stock falls to $10 and the owner decides to exercise the option, you are now OBLIGATED to buy 100 shares at $20.0, when they are selling on the open market for $10. Your loss would therefore be \[(20.0-10.0) \* 100\] - credited premium = Max Loss.

Selling a cash secured put is selling a put with an adequate amount of cash available to buy the shares if the underlying does drop below the strike and the option is exercised.

Suppose we are neutral to bullish on $MSFT so want to collect premium by selling a put.  Look at the option chain for 12/31 $MSFT below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uk00p9qj3w261.jpg?width=882&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e785e8ae40260339e52dc44034187fbc63551e9

We can sell the $MSFT 12/31 $205.0P and be credited $2.41, or $241.0.  There are a few things that can happen.  When you do this, you will need $20,500 to be a cash secured put. (Strike Price \* 100 = Necessary Collateral)

* The price of the underlying goes up, and the seller of the option (us) can *Buy to Close* the contract.  We have no further obligation to sell any shares at the strike price and the money that was held for collateral is released.  The profit of the contract is simply the difference in the premium when we Sold to Open and the now lower premium when we Buy to Close.
* The price of the underlying trades sideways.  This will result in theta decay of the option and we can Buy to Close once we hit our desired exit price or % gain.
* The price of the underlying drops below the strike price.  If this happens you can:
   * Buy to Close at a loss to release your collateral.  This might be a significant loss
   * Be assigned the stock.  By doing so you have now aggressively entered $MSFT at a lower price than it was on the day you sold the OTM Put.  As soon as you get assigned the shares, guess what we can do?  Sell to Open a Covered Call

Some quick notes on the CSP, you should only sell CSPs on stocks you are comfortable with being assigned and ones that you are bullish on.

Selling CSPs and CCs are the fundamentals of doing a strategy called the wheel, but not a strategy I am going to get into with this post.

***Debit Spreads***

Debit spreads are a way to bet on the directional movement of a stock while reducing both your maximum loss and your potential profit.

*Call Debit Spreads*

This is done by Buying to Open a call while Selling to Open a call with a higher strike price.  This allows us to use the credit received from Selling to Open (-1) contract to help lower the cost of the option we Buy to Open (+1).  Look at the $MSFT 12/31 options chain below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k20t4uy48w261.jpg?width=888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cde6714f5d20c7a86651e713b226fbfe4f0b624f

We want to Buy to Open the $MSFT 12/31 $220.0 call, which would cost us $4.15 if we do not use a debit spread.  BUT if we simultaneously Sell to Open the $225.0C for $2.56, we can lower the DEBIT we would need to open this trade.

1. This lowers the debit we need to pay for our trade from $4.15 to ($4.15 - $2.56 = **$1.59**)
2. This limits our max profit we can receive from the trade to the difference in the strike prices, so \[($225.0 - $220.0) \* 100\] - $159 = $341.

Check out this example put into Robinhood desktop below.

Notice my absolutely God Awful drawings.  We need to confirm that we have selected the right strike prices on the right expiration, and that we are DEFINITELY Buying to Open the lower strike and Selling to Open the further OTM higher strike. Robinhood helps us autists by putting a ""Call Debit Spread"" by our order.  If it says anything but this, you fucked up.  Notice circle 2, where we can see the strikes of the Calls we have chosen to Buy/Sell.  Below is what it looks like in mobile.

Notice how our max loss is realized until the stock price passes through our long call, increases, then it flattens out and is capped regardless of the price of the underlying at our max profit at stock prices $225.0 and beyond.

*Put Debit Spreads*

The process is exactly the same but inverted.  You are Buying to Open a put and Selling to Open a put with a lower strike price, but the principles are all the same.  If you don't understand this, let me know and I can type out a full example like the one above.

***Conclusion***

I hope that this in addition to the first one have been helpful.  I think these strategies will give everyone on this sub an advantage over the house we are trying to beat.  Again, best of luck.  Trade well.  Trade with passion.  YOLO but YOLO smart.

The last 2 SPAC mergers, QS on Nov.27, and LAZR since... Yesterday,  have popped in over ~150% gains in the week of the merger (including substantial dips). 

Arko Holdings LTD. is an Israeli-based company which owns over 3000 retail stores in USA over 20+ states, and looking for further business expansion next year.

My DD is based off their positive financials and revenue growth over COVID which leaves more hope for the future of brick&mortar stores, and they operate in convenience / groceries, which reminds me of $USFD (US Foods, spiking ~80% in the last 2 months), and a little of foreign companies like OZON (Russian e-commerce retailer similar to shop or amazon), gaining 20% in the last two weeks since IPO, due to foreigner companies doing US business/stock exchange.

Most importantly, last 2 SPAC mergers in QS and LAZR, are looking fire hot right now in their valuation increases, while both are in the EV bubble, Arko is already well established, and for a company about to merge at NAV, they are grossly undervalued. Arko Holdings trades on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange at ~76 USD, while remaining at ~10 USD NAV on NASDAQ.

HYAC + Arko SPAC will likely pop in the coming days, get it in while you can.

TLDR: New SPAC merger between HYAC and ARKO HOLDINGS sitting at NAV($10), very high upsides due to people on the EV train/bubble and not looking at other companies with established financials and growth - recent mergers in QS and LAZR indicate potential pops with low downsides. Get in while you can 🚀🚀🚀

**Major upside expected in the next 6-12 months with $FNMA---**

**Tldr:** This stock currently trades at **$2.50** and has gigantic upside in the next 12 months. The supreme court will hear arguments on December 9th challenging the government’s legal right to take over the company (hugely conservative court now that always vote against gov takeovers) AND Trump has gotten the ball rolling on doing it through the treasury with intent to do it before the Biden Inauguration. **Likely upside potential if either of these things happens = stock rises to $8-10.**

**Again this company is huge with a 2019 net income of $14.2B**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright you clowns, listen up. Incredibly strategic play here on Fannie Mae. Ever heard of it? Good.

This DD will give an easily  comprehensible  overview of FNMA and why this play is super compelling.

The Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as **Fannie Mae**, is a United States government-sponsored enterprise founded in the 1930’s and, since 1968, a publicly traded company. The purpose of Fannie Mae is to expand the secondary mortgage market by securitizing mortgage loans in the form of mortgage-backed securities, allowing lenders to reinvest their assets into more lending and in effect increasing the number of lenders in the mortgage market.

In other words, they basically buy mortgages (middle class people mortgages) from banks and chop them up in tiny pieces by issuing securities that are backed by them and then guarantee those securities. Basically, they are an insurer of super low risk assets.

Now this all may sound familiar and if mortgage-back securities sound familiar then you probably saw The Big Short or know a thing or two about the housing and financial crisis in 2008-2010. In the lead up to the housing crash, FNMA blew up because they were inadequately capitalized and started buying subprime mortgages (the big short explains this all well actually).

Following the housing crisis in 2008, Fannie Mae fell victim to a complete government takeover and the stock died. Shortly before the 2008 election, FNMA was place into conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. So basically, the government took FNMA over and injected a gigantic amount of money and capital into it.

In 2010, FNMA announced their stocks would be delisted from the NYSE. The Federal Housing Finance Agency directed the delisting after Fannie's stock traded below $1 a share for over 30 days. Since then the stocks have continued to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.

So, what was the outcome? At the time of the takeover, FNMA was written off and many believed it was destined for insolvency. But interestingly, the opposite happened. **In the years that followed, FNMA built capital and re-paid the loans back to the government with over 10% interest.**

Politics got in the way, however, and the Obama Admin refused to privatize the company and allow it to hit the normal markets again. The trump admin, however, was very interested in ending the games and removing government control, privatizing the company, and allowing it to re-list again on NYSE. Many of the bureaucratic steps necessary for this have already happened.

**This is where the timing of this buy is simply incredible. There are two upcoming decision points and a lot of context that make it likely this stock moons in the next 6 months.**

1. The Trump admin has 2 months remaining and some insiders believe strongly (and this is corroborated by the fact much of the leg work has been done) that they will make this deal prior to Biden being inaugurated. Trump treasury secretary has a particular fascination with this given his wall street background and wants to get the deal done.

**2) Secondly, and perhaps most important, is that on** ***December 9th***\*\*\*\*, the Supreme Court of the United States with hear a case as to whether or not the government expropriation of FNMA is legal or not.\*\* This again, is very important. The supreme court has changed dramatically in recent weeks and years and is now solidly a 6-3 heavily conservative court.\*\* Conservative courts are notorious for ruling against government take-over of private companies. The fact the court is hearing this case so soon after the most recent judge’s confirmation is likely telling (the court itself votes on which cases on appeal to even hear).

3) If either of these two things results in positive news for the reversal of the government involvement in this stock, insiders, including the **SPACMAN Bill Ackman** (whose holding company holds a big chunk of FNMA purchase in 2013 at around the current $2.50 price) believe that the stock will be guaranteed to rise by as much as 6X and at a minimum 2-3X. There would also likely be know delay in this rise, given how gigantic these companies are.

4) Finally, regardless of whether Trump or the Supreme Court makes this happen, things are on track for the change to take place under Biden in any case, it just may not be as quick and may happen sometime later in 2021.

Rolls Royce was in the middle of restructuring after writing down hundreds of millions of dollars due to unanticipated maintenance issues on their Trent 1000 jet engines (common on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner) when coronavirus hit and totally demolished the market for jet engines.

Additionally Brexit plus aggressive, reactionary Chinese foreign policy has impacted their ability to compete in many of the largest markets.

They have laid off thousands and were forced to raise a significant amount of capital.

This week we opened a new short position, which we believe will be more profitable that all our previous trades. The best way we can describe Jumia is an investment vehicle to swindle investors out of their money. Jumia at its core remains the same company that IPOed in 2019. Then there was a lot of concern about honesty of the management team--that concern remains. Investors who understand the proverb, “fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me”, would avoid investing in this highflying Nigerian company.

Jumia’s stock is running high due to an increase in demand that has already fizzled out. The company has no path to profitability. The demand for Jumia’s goods in the second and third quarter was not organic; it was mostly driven by store closures, supply problems, and an imitation of Western countries. Our research shows that Coronavirus fears in Africa were prevalent from mid-February to mid-August. After that period, people mostly stopped caring about Covid-19 and returned to their normal shopping habits. Jumia experienced an increase in demand from mid-April to mid-August. Hence, it was able to capitalize on Covid-19 fear by reducing advertisement expenses by 55%. The lag in start of expected increase in demand was mostly due to poor experience of ordering goods from Jumia. High rates of cancellations, failed deliveries and returns were a testament to that fact. High advertising budget is an essential and necessary part of Jumia’s business model. The profits Jumia can derive from each customer was and will never be more than the cost of customer acquisition. 

Revenue in the third quarter dropped despite onboarding more customers. During the golden time of e-commerce, total revenue dropped from $40.9 to $33.7 million. First party revenue (i.e. revenue from merchandise bought and sold by Jumia) dropped by 53% year on year in the third quarter. This pattern is in line with continuous reduction in in FPR reported in the previous quarters.

Jumia management executed a perfect share offering worth $243.2 million at an average price of $30.51. We see that as the management’s agreement with our thesis that shares prices are significantly inflated. We were able to initiate our short position at a slightly higher price.  

Two catalysts will burst this bubble: The next earnings report showing significant underperformance during the holiday season. We believe Jumia’s 2020 black-Friday and cyber-Monday sales were significantly lower than those of 2019. The second catalyst will be American investors rotating out of Covid-related stocks when a vaccine is approved in the United States.

To address a recent endorsement presentation by Citron Research about Jumia: we were able to read between the lines and decipher motivation of presenter. Hence, we are thankful to Citron Research making opening price of our short more attractive.  

In short, Jumia is our best short idea."

Its a heavy weight with a light weight price.

When you realize that its comparable to the other tech giants and its only $24!!!!! You realize that price is a steal. You don’t even have to buy options, you can just buy stock and watch your money triple by summer. It’s an investment.

Here are my reasons:

•It will eventually be an operating system ( like Microsoft :[Link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch) )

•It is backed by a billionaire

•It is backed by the US government

•This entire community loves the stock(mostly very rich people)

•They just signed a $300 million dollar deal… it’s on the website, is that reflected in the financials?If it is not, then I think the price needs to go up to adjust for that (asking not telling)

•This presentation is amazing: [https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc\_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf)

•The company is expanding at extremely rapid pace.

I recommend buying the stock. I am not a fan of hype for the sake of hype. I bought before the hype and I still believe in it now. "

However, I feel this is a good recovery point, someone drop some knowledge if you got any. It honestly looks like it’s forming another smaller head and shoulders. If someone can explain this better it seems that because of their redemption period they have to maintain a share price above $18 or forfeit being able to redeem their warrants at a price of $.01. Would that not mean we’re about to see a reversal to ensure they stay above that price?

Many a courageous autist ran up the SP during the split and we made good money up to that point. Now AFTER the split date, the stock price dropped from $540 to $300-ish. The IV got crushed and my calls were destroyed.

Fund managers are accumulating shares now so they won't have to buy them later at a higher price. This is great for call holders now because it is driving the price up.

Now, I believe the same type of crush will happen after the inclusion date as we saw after the merger date. Maybe a couple of days of elation after Dec21st but the irrational exuberance will subside and then, puts will print tendies.

I am a chemistry nerd and medical student. I don't know shit about the stock market and I hope ya'll can point out where I am wrong by doing your own DD. Here's my DD about NNOX technology and I hope you can see why I'm excited about it.  

**What is NNOX?**

Here's their company statement:  We have developed a digital X-ray source enabling a cost reduction of imaging systems by orders of magnitude. We are a global company planning mass deployment of imaging systems. Our goal is to drive  early detection preventive healthcare as a new standard of care.

Basically, they made a cheaper and smaller X-ray device. They currently have a 2D model (simple X-ray) and a 3D model (CT scan) called the Nano-X ARC. That's their whole thing. It sounds boring as hell and their CEO Ran Poliakine has said on multiple occasions that their product is not groundbreaking: ""X-ray is X-ray"".

**Why is their technology special?**

It isn't. Traditional X-ray and CT machines use a hot spinning cathode that is large and requires active cooling or long off-cycles to not break. Cold cathode tubes are nothing special, and have been around for a long time. In fact, there are cold-cathode X-rays already on the market ([Meiden](https://www.meidensha.com/news/news_03/news_03_01/1231258_3190.html), [Carestream](https://www.cmxmedicalimaging.com/product/carestream-drx-revolution-nano-mobile-x-ray-system/) \+ [Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/d9t1w5/testing_a_carestream_nano_portable_xray_unit/)).  What they are doing is comparable to replacing incandescent light bulbs with LEDs.

**Why is this exciting?**

Foxconn is why this is exciting. The cold cathode X-rays mentioned above use carbon nanotubes ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/437968a)). However, if you look at Nano-X images and promotional material, it seems to be almost like a semiconductor chip. They are making nanolithography-printed chips that can be cheaply mass-produced by Foxconn, who have invested in this technology ([Their engineer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11431-009-0156-7)). Nanolithography is basically printing on a very small scale, and I've been a major fanboy of this Northwestern scientist who pioneered it ([Mirkin](https://mirkin-group.northwestern.edu/project/dip-pen-nanolithograph/)). This is going to make these things cheap as hell (relatively).

**Monetization and business plan**

Their machines will initially be limited to whoever preordered them. They're selling them at a loss but charging per scan to make up the cost (estimated 1-3 years breakeven). Similar to game consoles nowadays. I don't have any idea what this means for their fundamentals but I can tell you the CT and X-ray machines at our hospital are constantly scanning and printing money for the hospital. Someone please tell me if this is a stupid business model so I can exit this position.

**NNOX started their IPO with a bang, then Citron and Muddy came in**

Their stock price was overbought on September 14th, and they were smeared as the next Theranos. Huge price drop. Keep in mind that their CEO has run a company into the ground, no academic papers were published, and no one has actually seen their machine work yet. The short sellers just pointed out the obvious. Then, NNOX announced they would showcase their device at the RSNA (Radiological Society of North America) where all the US radiologists visit (virtually) to bump shoulders and review academic research. Stock rose and dipped again in anticipation yesterday. The bar was so low. All NNOX needed to do was to show a working machine...

**AND THEY FUCKING DID IT (**[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcrzuODNhrs&t=14s)**)**

I got to see them do this shit live thanks to my professor! I bought the dip immediately (24 shares $88 avg) and it feels almost like insider trading. Basically, they showed a 2D scan and a 3D scan. The 2D scan was nothing special (XRAY is XRAY) but the CEO wanted to scan his own hand. However, the 3D scan was amazing. The 3D tomography was clearly noisy and crude, but the visualization is very high-res and crisp.

Some skeptics about the images say that their fake, but they look very real to me. The hand X-Ray matches his hand perfectly, and the 3D has peripheral noise as opposed to axial axial artifacts that a CT machine would produce. It looks like they may need some software engineers to tighten up image quality though. They also criticize him for not doing a live CT scan, which would take at least 15 minutes and would also give him an unhealthy dose of radiation. Another design flaw is that their ARC machine looks like it would not support fat people.

**Next moves**

They are filing an 501(K) FDA approval. I don't know much about their filing except that it's the ""we're releasing existing technology"" filing. These filings from what I know, are typically accepted. Some critics say they should be filing for a more exciting and risky FDA approval of some sort, but I think their tech is just old stuff used correctly. Hopefully their stock keeps rising as they approach approval next year. What are your thoughts especially on the business side of things?"

In all seriousness this is a great stock. Luminar has the best Lidar sensors which every car is going to have. The CEO is this genius 25 year old big dick Stanford drop out who engineered the best Lidar sensors. They already have contracts which will give them like 70% of the market.

It was up 30% premarket this morning, and then a big profit taking run from small sellers drove the price down, as well as big institutions depressing the price to buy in. But the actual value is up there. I believe this stock will hit $50 in the next two quarters.

What does it REALLY mean for your $BABA, $NIO etc.",124,k5uctb,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5uctb/mythbuster_house_passed_bill_to_curb_chinese/,51,"Some first words, **I have no prediction on how these stocks’ price is gonna move**. I know many of you have a position on these names. And I anticipate that **my post will be heavily downvoted**. I only write because I despise **those trolls who spread fake information for their own benefit**. Even if a couple of people who read my post can avoid the pitfall of being conned, my effort is not wasted.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is this “Kennedy-Von Hollen bill” about?**

Congress established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to inspect audits of public companies. Currently, **Chinese government refuses to allow the PCAOB to inspect audits of companies registered in China and Hong Kong**. This led to the massive scandal and eventual delisting of Luckin Coffee. The Kennedy-Von Hollen bill aims to prohibit securities of a company from being listed on any of the U.S. securities exchanges if the company has failed to comply with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s (PCAOB) audits for three years in a row.

**Source**: Government website [https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies](https://www.kennedy.senate.gov/public/2020/12/house-passes-kennedy-van-hollen-bill-to-protect-americans-from-fraudulent-foreign-companies)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 1: This bill does not apply to companies like $BABA or $NIO, because they are already using American auditors.**

**BUSTED**. For example, $NIO uses PricewaterhouseCoopers **Zhong Tian LLP**, which is a **China-based** auditor. **PCAOB currently CANNOT inspect audits from $NIO, or $BABA, or many other Chinese companies**.

**Source**: the **official PCAOB website** where you can find that $NIO is listed as a DENIED ISSUER AUDIT CLIENT

[https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/denied-access-to-inspections?searchWithin=NIO](https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/denied-access-to-inspections?searchWithin=NIO)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 2: PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP is registered with PCAOB. This means PCAOB is able to inspect $NIO’s audits.**

**BUSTED**. An accounting firm being registered with PCAOB **does NOT mean its audits can be inspected**. (To be honest I am quite surprised the internet trolls can dig this far in order to twist facts. They even know the firm is registered. Wow.)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 3: Whether Trump signs this bill or not does not matter at all, because he will soon leave the White House.**

**BUSTED**. Trump is still the president. After the bill passes both Senate and House, **if president signs, the bill becomes a legislation and will be enforced**. Unless this bill gets repealed after Biden takes over, it will have a lasting impact. And since this bill has gained **unanimous bipartisan support**, it is highly unlikely that the bill will be repealed.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 4: Because Trump’s TikTok ban hasn’t been successful so far, the Chinese stock delisting bill will not be enforced either.**

**BUSTED**. These are totally different matters. Trump’s TikTok ban is an **executive order**, **not a law**. Executive orders can be overturned by judges. Whereas, if the Kennedy-Von Hollen bill is signed by Trump, it will become **legislation**.

If anything this tells you, **China did NOT prevent TikTok's US operation from being sold to Oracle. It won't be a surprise if eventually they will NOT prevent from these stocks being delisted.**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 5: This bill is fake, because it is passed by Senate first and House second. Real bills get passed in House first.**

**BUSTED**. God, I am so disappointed in the new generation’s understanding of our own government. **Senate bill, proposed by senators, will be voted in the Senate first**. And since this bill is proposed by Senator John Kennedy and Senator Chris Van Hollen, this is a Senate bill. (As an American citizen, **please try to understand how our own government works**)

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 6: $NIO spokeswoman says they have become compliant over the past few months, which means $NIO will not be subject to this bill.**

**PROBABLY INACCURATE**. They can only “**TRY**” to comply with the regulations, but whether they “**CAN**” is **not really up to them**. **It is NOT the companies themselves that are against the inspection of audits, it is the Chinese government.**

**Source**: the damn SEC chairman Jay Clayton himself [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-vital-role-audit-quality-and-regulatory-access-audit-and-other)

“**China’s state security laws are invoked** at times to limit U.S. regulators’ ability to oversee the financial reporting of U.S.-listed, China-based companies. In particular, **Chinese laws governing the protection of state secrets and national security have been invoked to limit foreign access to China-based business books and records and audit work papers**.”

It is outside companies’ power to comply with US regulations, because the issue concerns Chinese state security law. **You think these companies will disobey Chinese state security laws just to comply with US listing rules?** If the Chinese government says No, there will be no way they can be compliant, no matter how they “**TRY**”.

**Source**: another Chinese EV maker $LI even mentioned such uncertainty in its SEC filing.

“the adoption of any rules, legislations or other efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information could cause uncertainty, and **we could be delisted if we are unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement in time**”

They may not, but they **COULD**.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MYTH 7: The Chinese will make compromise to avoid delisting, because they are weaklings and they always make concessions to the US.**

**UNCERTAIN**. I can’t imagine how people can just go around vouching this as a fact. Do they work for the Chinese government? Are they the officials responsible for the negotiations? How can this be a certainty already?

If you bet that the Chinese will make compromises, **you are basically betting that Chinese will back down from its own state security law**. **It is possible that they will, but it’s far from certainty**. They have not compromised on an “independent investigation of coronavirus origin” in Wuhan. They have not compromised on the National Security Law enacted in Hong Kong. How on earth can you be so sure that they will compromise on their own state security law?

The negotiation on PCAOB inspection between the US and China has taken 10 years. China has not yet compromised in the past 10 years. But now suddenly they will just yield? Is this really logical thinking, or **purely your imagination?**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Can these Chinese stocks go up? Not impossible. Can they go down? Also possible. Whether you buy or sell, consider the risks, and **don’t get manipulated by those who are spreading lies for their own benefit.**"

Ive seen elon blasting LiDar tech saying its trash:
https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/

""They're all going to dump lidar,"" Elon Musk said at an April event showcasing Tesla's self-driving technology. ""Anyone relying on lidar is doomed.""

""Lidar is really a shortcut,"" added Tesla AI guru Andrej Karpathy. ""It sidesteps the fundamental problems of visual recognition that is necessary for autonomy. It gives a false sense of progress, and is ultimately a crutch.""

But also a bunch of companies are using it, considering even the fucking army uses it:
https://idstch.com/technology/photonics/military-applications-lidar/

""by combining the laser range, laser scan angle, laser position from GPS, and laser orientation from Inertial Navigation System. Additional information about the object, like its velocity or material composition, can also be determined by measuring cert""

Again i have shares in LAZR and i am probably going to sound biased but who is right here?

Papa Elon has never steered us wrong, but the might dick of the US Army hasnt either.

In my honest opinion, i feel that LiDar is in its infancy, and even if Papa Musk is right, LAZR can sell their tech to other industries like air travel/space/defense

You have to understand, those people don’t realize this is a casino. All of the meme stocks, the PLTR, NIO, PRPL, whatever next week’s flavor is gonna be, are extremely volatile, and, you're probably not going to have them for 2+ years, but these people will. You can’t recommend they buy those, because, like, imagine how stupid you are. Then, realize that your parents actually made you, so they’re just as retarded too. They’re gonna buy PLTR at the top and get fucked by JP/Citron, because they don’t know any better. Even if it did, they don’t think about their ‘next play’. They’re already asking YOU for advice, I mean come on, they obviously have no fucking clue what they’re doing. You are assuming a risk to your relationship based on how stupid they are. But you also need to get them to shut up and leave you alone, so what do you say?

This is what you need to say. “Just buy SPY/QQQ and hold”. It’s foolproof. Even if the entire market tanks, you just say “well look at the S&P and the Nasdaq, the whole market is down, not my fault”. Then they’ll be happy with their 10% gains. You won’t be getting any extra inheritance, but you’re not going to get disowned. They’ll look up the chart for SPY/QQQ, be like wow it goes up, looks safe, they’ll buy and hold forever while you get drilled by your increasingly OTM calls. They may be able to buy you some Wendies as commission when you end up losing everything in your own account and have to move back home.

But I know you all probably don't have the attention span to read through it.

FCX has been steadily climbing since COVID and shot up to $24.57 immediately following market open today which was the signal to buy.

Everything was moving up, seemed like any skeptical news was already priced in, but then after 3:30 major index funds (and several company stocks) had huge crashes of near 90 degree angles down.

It happened with all 3 big index ETFS, QQQ, SPY, and DIA. In Spy's case the crash caused it to be red for the day (sorry for those who got smacked by that one lol. Especially option traders)

The only recent news I can see that may cause concern was one of the vaccine manufacturers  had cut down the amount of vaccines it could produce but that was earlier and priced in, and superseded by the ""implication"" that a new stimulus was ""close"" to being negotiated in Congress.

I don't see any other recent MAJOR news that would cause that kind of drop."
448,Diabetic Due Diligence on DEXCOM Inc. (DXCM) and Why I BOUGHT THE DIP and YOLO’d 80k.,33,k5yf5i,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5yf5i/diabetic_due_diligence_on_dexcom_inc_dxcm_and_why/,42,"As you autists know, BUY THE FUCKING DIP. For the last few months, I have watched this sub decay into exclusively meme stocks, SPACS, EV, GYNA companies, Weed stocks, and a government backed Skynet. Instead of presenting real buying opportunities, WSB has been filled with pump and dumps and shit stocks. This is not that, this is a real market opportunity to make gains by BUYING THE FUCKING DIP. This DXCM dip has been completely overlooked by WSBets...because once again, you're all fucking degenerate autists. I know this because I am too, I participated in many of the swings and after breaking my neck a couple times, the whiplash caused me to do my own research and fall back on the most basic principle BUY THE FUCKING DIP.

I believe so strongly in this position that I have YOLO'd $80k into DXCM calls. You can see my positions and my ass at the bottom of this post.

Now my analysis of DXCM is broken down into 7 parts: The Product and Increasing Market Share, \~FuNdAmEnTaLs\~, price targets, Revenue, Earnings, Partnerships, Competition, COVID impacts, and most importantly THE DIP. This post is pretty long, but the TL;DR is that this company is recovering quickly from a massive dip, dominates the market, and presents a great tendies taking opportunity.

**The Product and Increasing Market Share**

DEXCOM is undoubtedly the best diabetes management device in the market and their market shares continue to grow as more Type 1 diabetics are switching from syringes and finger pricks to insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors.

Dexcom is currently the market leader in continuous glucose monitors. If you don't know what a continuous glucose monitor is, simply put, Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) tracks glucose levels throughout the day and night and can alert Type 1 Diabetics if their levels go too high or low. CGM systems take glucose measurements at regular 5 minute intervals, 24/7, and translate them into dynamic data to show glucose direction and rate of change. Dexcom CGM tracks glucose levels continuously throughout the day and night, while simultaneously sending glucose readings to the user's smart device or receiver every five minutes. Dexcom CGM then translates readings into dynamic data so that Type 1 diabetics are better able to manage treatment.

**\~FuNdAmEnTaLs\~**

**Price Targets and Strong Buy Recommendation** \- Avg Price Target of **$445.60**, Currently trades at $334

DXCM is currently trading more than $100 under its price target and is closing the gap rapidly as it recovers from its recent November dip. See the Analyst Consensus Rating below:

[AVG. PRICE TARGET $445.60](https://preview.redd.it/jceur9o6su261.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b2c196f05dfd7bdf3444e42aa3066d4ac15e4b1)

DXCM is currently rated as a Strong Buy by almost all analysts.

[DXCM = Strong Buy ](https://preview.redd.it/g6x9gc0e8v261.png?width=678&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e967ca9c66ade9770a0419e6ab244a4c2114490)

**Steady Revenue Growth, Balance Sheet, and Growing Market Share -** Dexcom Revenue continues to steadily climb and just passed half a billion last quarter with positive cash flow on its balance sheet, a growing market share, and an increase in Continuous Glucose Monitor users worldwide.

[Continued Revenue Growth ](https://preview.redd.it/g031y7q60v261.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f86e4f844f99fb49e1d4d8ac09ece7ace2acdd)

**Earnings -** Dexcom does not miss on earnings and has consistently beaten expectations by wide margins. I expect they will continue to do so next year as more diabetics get back to regular endocrinologist appointments. See the graph below:

[DEXCOM ALWAYS BEATS EARNINGS](https://preview.redd.it/u6vuq1vfzu261.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e50be2755bc34b313d7dd6fafa0e2f480997fc9)

**Key Partnerships -** From Wikipedia - ""[Tandem Diabetes Care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_Diabetes_Care) received FDA approval in December 2019 for Control-IQ, a closed-loop technology that uses Tandem's t:slim X2 insulin pump and the Dexcom G6 to ""to automatically increase, decrease, or stop the delivery of insulin in response to the glucose levels of people with Type 1 diabetes."" Dexcom entered into a partnership with Livongo, a digital chronic care management company, in January 2020 to share CGM data from the Dexcom G6 with Livongo’s platform. This integration will allow Livongo to incorporate the CGM data along with other patient data to provide health insights based on its algorithm to help patients manage their diabetes. In February 2020, Dexcom and Insulet Corporation signed a non-exclusive, global agreement to combine current and future Dexcom continuous glucose monitoring systems with Insulet’s tubeless insulin delivery Pod into the Omnipod Horizon™ System for automated insulin delivery. This will give the ability to adjust insulin doses based on Insulet’s algorithm or through their smartphone. The company also announced in March 2020 a partnership with Welldoc to integrate G6 CGM data with BlueStar, a digital platform for diabetes management. BlueStar will combine the CGM data with information on patients' activity, nutrition, sleep and other factors to help them manage their condition."" [\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexcom#cite_note-25)

**Little Competition and Positive Market Sentiment**

There are 3 major players in the Continuous Glucose Monitor market. They are Dexcom, Guardian Medtronic, and Freestyle Libre. Dexcom is by far the most advanced, accurate and used device of these three. I will try to highlight the main advantages of the Dexcom over the competition, but I highly recommend you look into the reviews and research around the accuracy and features of these devices. The points below are from SugarMDs - [https://sugarmds.com/dexcom-g6-versus-freestyle-libre-cgm/#:\~:text=CGM(%20Dexcom%20or%20libre)%20is,an%20insulin%20pump%20or%20independently](https://sugarmds.com/dexcom-g6-versus-freestyle-libre-cgm/#:~:text=CGM(%20Dexcom%20or%20libre)%20is,an%20insulin%20pump%20or%20independently)

1. Dexcom has nightime monitoring for increased safety - ""One of the biggest risks that a person faces is highs and lows while they are sleeping. A Dexcom G6 and Guardian Medtronic (but not Libre) CGM system can monitor and alert you at night should your blood glucose drops. Unfortunately freestyle libre does not have that feature.  You can also choose to notify someone about your blood sugar levels by sharing your glucose data. The timely warning can prevent you from experiencing side effects related to highs and lows.
2. Accuracy - ""Between the Dexcom versus libre, Dexcom appears to be more accurate in the low glucose ranges below 80 mg/dL compared to libre.""
3. No finger pricks - The dexcom, unlike Guardian Medtronic which needs to be calibrated at least once every 12 hours, does not require any finger pricks to calibrate the device. This saves patients hundreds of dollars on test strips and is one of the best features of the device behind it's accuracy.
4. Customer Service, Reputation, and Retention - Top of the line customer service that is dedicated to serving patients. ""If a sensor stops working or doesn’t insert correctly, tech support is easy to get a hold of. After a few questions, they will replace a sensor that does not work. They might even send two."" [https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre](https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre)

&#x200B;

**COVID Impacts**

1. COVID created increased awareness of the importance of monitoring underlying conditions. I believe this will be a huge driving force behind growing revenues and market shares for Dexcom. Diabetics are now, more than ever, acutely aware of the need to monitor their Diabetes closely and Dexcom is the best product for that.
2. Increased Dexcom orders as patients return to quarterly endocrinologist appointments. Although, Dexcom beats earnings every quarter, I believe they will have even larger beats in 2021 as more patients transition back to seeing their care providers in person and will be able to see the products for themselves in medical offices.

**Buy the Dip - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT**

In November, Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen slashed his 12-month price target on the stock from $420 to $350. Biegelsen cited increased competition and pricing pressure in the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) space following the approval of Abbott Labs' Freestyle Libre 3 CGM in Europe. Abbott's CGM system is reportedly priced at $1,066 per year, whereas DexCom's G6 device runs about $2,496 per year.

This slashed price target was unjustified and the Analyst Consensus Rating above confirms that with an average price target of $445.60. It was unjustified for two specific reasons.

First, there is major consensus and sentiment among diabetics that Dexcom is the most accurate continuous glucose monitor on the market justifying its higher cost (See here - [https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre](https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/t1d-blog/2020/6/22/dexcom-g6-vs-freestyle-libre) or look at r/diabetes_t1 to get a feel for the love that surrounds the Dexcom and the impact that it has on the lives of Type 1 diabetics).

Second, the pricing differential did not justify such a drastic price slash. This is because for an ever growing number of patients insurance covers the cost of these continuous glucose monitors so price isn't a factor as diabetics always hit their deductibles due to insulin costs. Additionally, people do not skimp on price or often choose the cheaper device when it comes to their health. The reliability and accuracy of the Dexcom justifies its higher price. It's the best on the market and diabetics know it.

Anyway, as you can see from the graph. The stock has dipped from $420 to around $320 in the past month, but is quickly picking up momentum back towards the average analyst price target of $445.60. Moreover, pre-COVID the stock was trading at $456.23 and will likely blow past its ATH over the next year.

[Dip to $320 in Nov. Currently Rebounding back to $400+](https://preview.redd.it/8gla7g5dpu261.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4d0c429c14096253284c6b447f67e012f4fac4b)

**The Play**

I think this stock will run and run fast over the next couple months in anticipation of February earnings and as institutions dump their money back into a stable medical company. I would recommend playing stocks or long term ATM or ORM LEAP calls as DXCM has low options liquidity atm. The idea is to profit from the November dip that I touched on above. I am in for $80k total. I am all in and believe in this position, I would not be posting if I didn't think this was a sure thing. These are the trades:

**1) $5k in DXCM $340c 1/15**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Buy 2021 Leaps on DXCM, they are the best products on the market and currently heavily undervalued and recovering rapidly from a major dip.

**\*Personal Note and Kiss My Ass\***

On a personal note, I myself am a Type 1 Diabetic that uses the Dexcom CGM. I transitioned earlier this year from the Guardian Medtronic CGM and the device has been life changing. It has lowered my A1C levels, made my diabetes incredibly more manageable, and conveniently links with my iPhone and Apple watch which has made it a very enjoyable device to use. I've also attached a photo of my device so you can also get a feel for what the Dexcom CGM looks like and so that you autist fucks can kiss my ass when this play makes you tendies.

They’re trying to get 32billion valuation. I already know it’s gonna get pumped. My question is which of the 3 DoorDash, GrubHub, Uber do y’all think is the best?

Doordash valuation 23.8 - 27 billion approx. outstanding shares 317.7 million after ipo approx. raising about 2.8 billion about $75 - $85 last round raised in late June at 16 billion valuation. Had 1.9 billion in revenue in last 9 month about 543 million customers and adj. ebitda -149 million

Q1 revenue 362 million adj. ebitda -129 million

Q2 revenue 675 million adj. ebitda 23 million

Q3 revenue 879 million adj. ebitda -43 million


Uber eat while is a part of Uber and ubers ride sharing has taken a hit you can say Uber eats approx. valuation is 37.3 - 56 billion (40% - 60% Uber value) outstanding shares 1.76 billion.
About 3.1 billion revenue unknown number of customers (remember seeing somewhere they had over 500mil customer too) adj. ebitda -728 million in 9 months

Q1 revenue 819 million adj. ebitda -313 million (Uber eats only)

Q2 revenue 1.211 billion adj. ebitda -232 million (Uber eats only)

Q3 revenue 1.451 billion adj. ebitda -183 million (Uber eats only)

GrubHub valuation 6.46 billion and shares outstanding 92.75 million and revenue last 9 months 1.316 billion and adj ebitda of 78 million
About 300 million customers

Q1 revenue 363 million adj. ebitda 21 million

Q2 revenue 459 million adj. ebitda 13.3 million

Q3 revenue 494 million adj. ebitda 43.7 million

supposedly doordash has 50% of market shares but I don’t believe that based off the numbers and number of locations. Uber had higher GOV and slightly higher revenues and both Uber and doordash had about 500 million customers still Uber reported slightly more. I believe Uber and doordash to be almost equal in market share Uber 37% doordash 35% GrubHub 23% other 5%. Now the question is GrubHub crazy undervalued if doordash and Uber eats both worth over 25 billion? Grubhub would be easier to pump lower float. But doordash is gonna have ipo hype

TLDR: Which of the 3 food delivery is the best to invest in Doordash, Uber (Uber Eats), GrubHub?

474,CROWDSTRIKE |OKTA | SNOWFLAKE |CHINA STOCKS ON THE WATCH| FAANG STOCKS & STOCK MARKET NEWS [12-03],26,k5xbdq,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5xbdq/crowdstrike_okta_snowflake_china_stocks_on_the/,13,"**Snowflake flops on earnings, while CrowdStrike and Okta spike, Will Chinese companies get delisted from the US? Let’s talk about what happened yesterday in the stock market**

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw both the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/sKKNVjr) and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/PzxfrWt) up about 0,2% with the SP closing at a new record high while the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/f909849) trailed and finished just below the previous close, down only 0,05%. We did see a spike in the [VIX](https://ibb.co/QMqhtMv) of almost 2% as this was quite a volatile day with the market dropping at the open before regaining traction in the middle of the trading day. We saw a relatively even market yesterday as 56% of companies were advancing on below average volume as most of the companies continue to trade well above the moving averages. The leading [sectors](https://ibb.co/d0740g8) yesterday were Energy and Financials with Materials and Real Estate lagging the market as [Small and Large Cap value plays](https://ibb.co/hLDgLmm) kept the market positive with companies like Boeing being up [more than 5%](https://ibb.co/b3jRN2s) for the day after good news on multiple fronts like Ryanair [probably](https://ibb.co/8xpKXxQ) acquiring new planes and the [first flights made](https://ibb.co/qmJNkPc) with the new 737 by American.

[STOCK MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/BPVFx2d)

Here is a complete [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TKsdbDn) from yesterday as we saw an even market as I said earlier, with Salesforce being the only big looser in big caps as the stock continued to dive after the Slack news. I think this was a great opportunity to buy the stock in a dip as I doubled my portfolio value on the company from 1,5% to 3% of my portfolio while also getting in [more](https://ibb.co/Pr47Th5) on Boeing, Apple, Netflix and a couple of other companies.

We also got the AAII investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/KxkbTbb) yesterday as the percentage of bulls has increased constantly in the last month. This is usually a very bad sign for the stock market as corrections, consolidations or even crashes occur when people tend be over-bullish. I don’t think this will be the case at least for a couple of weeks, though I think we are poised for a small market correction in the near future before moving on even higher.

Here is the most interesting [economic data](https://ibb.co/PD2XBsn) that will be released today as we get new jobless claims as well as services PMI and ISM. I expect the jobless claims to continue to get worse sadly for the next couple of weeks at least until the vaccine starts to get distributed with ADP November jobs [numbers](https://ibb.co/S6V64xJ) coming in yesterday shy of forecasts and at the lowest level since July, this is not great news for the jobless claims that will pop up early today. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/wQ3mK2b)

\[Later EDIT\] - Jobless claims came in way better than expected : [NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/Jscz1SZ)

Great news came in this morning as the US is [expected](https://ibb.co/vYp0LDT) to have capability to immunize at least 100 million people by the end of February, that is great news, as specialist believe a herd immunity can be reached if there are about 60-80% of people either immunized or have already developed natural antibodies.

We also have a couple of interesting earnings [scheduled](https://ibb.co/6nJjrRY) for Today, as I expect Kroger to beat the estimates, though I didn’t get any action on this, I did get some [action](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) on [Marvell](https://ibb.co/34x6mpN) as I bought the stock about a week ago. While I expected Dollar General to do alright and I think we might see some disappointment in [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/BPsz5Mj) just like I thought we would see bad reaction to great earnings with Zoom.

\[Later Edit:

\-Dollar General [reported](https://ibb.co/gJPRpXM) a beat on top & bottom line but did not offer guidance and the shares of the company have pulled back in pre-market trading 1,6%

\-Kroger [beats EPS](https://ibb.co/bgsMckw) by 0,05$ but misses on revenue by $310M, shares down 4% pre-market\]

Alongside Marvell which I expect to beat the estimates of 25cents per share and also beat on revenue, I also [bought](https://ibb.co/y0ThT5D) Okta which released earnings yesterday and [crushed](https://ibb.co/VmvBzYV) expectations as recurring [subscription revenue](https://ibb.co/nftnckz) grew by more than 40% year over year as well as big increases in operating margins, billings and customers. This led the stock to [spike 8%](https://ibb.co/xzyy0qr) after hours as I will make a good profit on the investment and may even consider holding this position for the long term in the company.

Also, one other staple company from my [portfolio](https://ibb.co/pKbNy8M), CrowdStrike released earnings yesterday and delivered great [results](https://ibb.co/dgyfn8g) as the annual recurring [revenue](https://ibb.co/N6vhWfW) has grown more than 80% year over year while adding over 11hundred new subscriptions this quarter while also improving [gross margins](https://ibb.co/THfGJ2c) by 2%. The company also gave guidance for next quarter way over analyst expectations as that made the [stock soar 13%](https://ibb.co/ZGxbsRx)

The only big disappointment from earnings released yesterday was [SNOWFLAKE](https://ibb.co/6BhYKHC) as they have suffered the same way as Palantir in the first earnings report as analysts were expecting even bigger numbers after the huge rally the stock has had since the IPO. One Morgan Stanley analyst said that they needed to deliver around a 140% growth of revenue to make a good impact on the stock as the company’s revenue only grew up 102%. If it continues to drop it might find the way to a good entry point, but for the moment I believe this price is to high for the company.

We also got news yesterday as the House [passed](https://ibb.co/w0Ly1MP) the billt hat allows Chinese companies to be delisted if they do not comply with new auditing rules, as this measure is expected to by signed fast by Trump.

I think this is good news for investors in the long-run as I don’t believe big companies like Alibaba will suffer from this, with BABA being audited by established PWC Hong Kong auditors, though this might be a bigger problem for smaller companies that are not able to follow the rules. I still believe Alibaba is a great company to buy at this price point as the company has [dropped](https://ibb.co/W283kbG) due to bad news developments in the last 2 months, but I think has a lot of room to go higher, even testing the previous highs of 319$ and surpassing them, especially with this holiday season having great sales numbers.

This news combined with the recent [upgrade](https://ibb.co/c2mwgPc) at Goldman was music to the ears of Tesla investors as the stock rose almost 3% after hours and erased the daily losses.

Other news came as the House is expected to vote on the [MORE ACT](https://ibb.co/RgjnPgY), though this will be surely blocked in the Senate, this is still good news for the cannabis sector as states will likely legalize this way before we can a national bill.

While Palantir dropped big yesterday after Morgan Stanley [warned](https://ibb.co/m4NsSWr) for a negative-risk reward in the stock as the stock has dropped more than 20% in the last 5 trading days, I sold out of my position on Palantir for a 40% profit recently but I may get back in if the price starts to make more sense.

So, with the latest developments, I believe investors should not forget about the FAANG stocks that have brought us back from the depths of the March lows. [FACEBOOK](https://ibb.co/gFd1S5R) still gives small business that will be back when the economy returns the best bang for the buck in advertising, especially with the great platform that Instagram has become.

While [APPLE](https://ibb.co/j4YW4Qy) seems to be doing very well with the iPhone 12 sales and the new 5G cycle while also growing the services business very fast, that will bring them more and more steady cash flows for the company.

Despite missing the latest sub numbers, [NETFLIX](https://ibb.co/LJ8fr37), is still producing a lot of great content, has the most subs and the most content available for streaming and I believe they will remain the best in business alongside with Disney+

What can you say about [AMAZON](https://ibb.co/nrD5qnY) as they are a death star for every sector they get in… E-commerce is here to stay, and Amazon still has huge room for growth especially in Europe and Asia.

While [GOOGLE](https://ibb.co/tz2htpn) was the laggard for most of the year, with travel & entertainment returning to advertising, this will be very good for the company, as travel is the biggest advertiser usually.

This companies will remain great owns for the long run, even if they underperform now, which I don’t expect, in the long-run this will remain some of the biggest winners in this new economy.

And don’t forget December is usually a great month for stocks as people tend to not take profits on capital gains at the end of the year, so it is likely that people will keep the winners while also receiving a boost from the stock market Santa Claus effect.

**What about IPOB ( Opendoor)?**

For me it's a hold/wait. I missed the wave and most people did but it's apples and oranges can't compare the too.

Majority people in here don't understand or own real estate and will say IPOB ( Opendoor) is more exciting because of Cathy Wood and it's ability to disrupt the real estate industry. Or they will say [Porch.com](https://Porch.com) is an angielist or something else. Again competition is good and not all business succeed.

But basically Opendoor is 10x better at ibuying compared to Zillow but Zillow has the strongest MOAT at the moment and make Majority of their revenue from Buyer Agents(ME). Opendoor is disrupting the Listing Agent side not the Buyers Agent side. They will provide leads to buyers agent my guys.

1. A company which sees consecutive days of +20% then pulls back for a few days is not dead lol
2. Don't give WSB financial advice to anyone, especially not you're mom lol
3. Just because you lucked out 600% on an option, once, does not make you experienced
4. Don't quit your job to become a day trader, you will get fucked over multiple time, sans lube
5. You can't access bb terminal without a license, and before you ask, you wont afford one
6. Don't play the options casino if you can't afford to get crushed
7. Don't try to make up for you crushed options with more options, seriously 95% of you will get rekt.

1. SOR: You need to understand that for every position there is a buyer and a seller.If you are trading short term, you want to be going against liquidity(news).
2. *Warren Buffett* quote:  “The *stock market* is a *device* for *transferring money* from the *impatient* to the *patient*.If you are trading long term, you need to be patient and have enough bankroll to cover your positions.
3. Support and Resistance

This determines how much bank roll you will need to cover that position. It can show you where you can enter and take profit.

If you are trading stocks, you can use software that shows you where the big money is going and you can follow the money.

I bought 1,000 shares of NTZ for $2.52/share.  I think it ended that day under $2.  It ends up tanking down to the low 1s and staying there for a while.  

I forget all about it, then one day notice that my losses have been erased and it has started to turn a profit.  When I bought it, I thought it was another Covid stock, but turns out to be an Italian furniture company.  

It slowly starts making me a few hundred dollars a day, then all of a sudden it goes up to 4, 5, and a week later up to 7.  At this point I should sell but don’t.  Then it goes under 5 and a week or two later, back in the 7s, where it started this week.  Of course NOW I definitely should sell, but still I don’t.  Yesterday it jumps to 9 and today 11.   Surely it can’t keep going up?  Right?  Am I crazy not to sell tomorrow morning? 


TLDR:  So I am now up almost $9,000 profit from a $2,500 investment on a stock I bought by mistake!  Do I try to squeeze more out of this, or am I absolutely retarded if I don’t take my gains and run!

UPDATE:  
Thanks for all the great advice and great shit talking!  So I decided to set a trailing stop quote at 8%.  Which I believe means that I get to continue enjoying gains until it slips to 8% of the most recent high, where it will automatically trigger a sale at that price.  If anyone can confirm this, that would be great!  

And wouldn’t you know it, the stock is still going up and in the 12s today.  I don’t know how to explain it, but I think I’m locked to sell at no less than 11.22 which would be $8,700 profit!"

I came across an interesting nugget -it seems GME is actually Burry's **largest** position because apparently 13-F filings don't report the market value of options correctly.

But the fact of the matter is there is just too much smoke for there not to be fire. I have seen a lot of ""yolo"" posts about this ticker that are 95% in the stock.... when you have a floor of 25% downside risk I don't think that qualifies as a yolo, more just an asymmetrical investment and probably a smart move in a volatile market.

This video pretty much outlines why it's a safe bet and a sound investment.

but that's not why I'm here. This has been a long time coming.

Let me start by saying that I got into ""investing"" years ago with a couple hundred bucks just fucking around on E\*TRADE spending $7 to buy $25 worth of stock only to find out it was $7 to sell it. Later on, I found out about an app called Robinhood that was made for window licking retards like myself. It was glorious, I could day trade up to 3x in one day before I lost everything and got locked out of my account for a week. I enjoyed it greatly.

Then on December 23rd 2019 I saw an article on Marketwatch about how Draftkings was going public thru a SPAC. I didn't know what the fuck a SPAC was but it was just days before Christmas so I had a couple days off to research it. I took the couple hundred bucks in my account and I bought all the $DEAC I could get my hands on. Since then I have found this sub with other degenerate gamblers and retards like myself. Between the success of $DEAC / $DKNG, $PLTR, and $TQQQ (and others I can not mention) I managed to turn that 2K into over $80,000

I have been following the $PSTH saga thru infamousbreadfruit AKA Yolocapitalinc on twitter, since early October...

The Jackie Reses situation is just too coincidental. She previously she spent seven years handling mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs, the works at the Head of Square Capital for 5 years, then joins the board of $PSTH, then goes on Twitter and ""liked"" a picture of the Stripe logo... v sus if you ask me...

The recent influx of videos to hit twitter have the story

I don't come on here much to be honest but there's also some good DD that has been posted in the past that is easily accessible. Anyways I know I am going on and on but the point is I am going all fucking in.

I recently refinanced on my house to get a great rate and decided to take some cash out to ""invest""...

I'm taking the 80K profit this year from that other shit, throwing the cash out from the mortgage (20K) into half option calls, half shares on $PSTH. Yolo is relative. I basically live paycheck to paycheck and this is well over a year's salary.

1. Pick a SOLO theme and stick to your conviction.  
2. Buy calls months out.  
3. Split your buying up into bunches. If you wanted to buy $50k of something, buy $10k to start and buy $5k on every solid bounce in either direction (dip or boost) you see.  
4. Roll calls out a month ahead if shit isn't going your way yet.    
5. Have a target and be willing to pull out once you hit it or at least significantly scale back.   
6. Don't be afraid to walk away if shit clearly isn't working. How idiots stuck by NKLA after the truck rolling video is a good example here. Sure it worked for a little while longer, but the greed got crushed recently.  
  
  
Don't do weeklies unless you don't like your money. Don't follow random advice, it works sometimes it doesn't other times. Stick to your plan. Using OptionsProfitCalculator and other tools to see if it's even worth the risk is a good place to start. Asking yourself questions like is this even possible for this to do what I'm hoping it does - is a good place to start.      
    
TL;DR - Have a plan, stick to it, adapt as shit happens."

From the FT

https://www.ft.com/content/5a5aa2a6-0888-49b9-92f5-8fbf967bf283?segmentid=acee4131-99c2-09d3-a635-873e61754ec6

Quick quiz: What do Virgin Galactic and Plug Power have in common?

On the face of it they are totally unrelated companies. The former offers day-trips to space for the unspeakably wealthy, the latter hydrogen fuel systems for equipment and electric cars. But both soared double digits Wednesday on seemingly no news:

What they share is that both have become the object of co-ordinated buying by users on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets. If you’re not familiar with this particular corner of the world’s most popular messageboard, it’s where retail punters go to discuss their punts, and much more besides. “Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal,” as the website accurately describes itself.

Scroll through it today and you’ll find dozens of posts boasting of giant gains on call options and straight equity purchases with Virgin Galactic and Plug Power, along with punter-favourites Tesla, Nvidia and AMD.

Normally retail investor activity is but a drop in the ocean in the $30tn US equity market. Not this time. The behaviour is so pronounced that options trading has been showing up in aggregate market data, as Jennifer Ablan reported Wednesday:

While the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq have surged to record highs in recent weeks, another rally has taken hold. The US options market has been experiencing a huge jump in trading — led by large-capitalisation companies including Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Disney, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Vishal Vivek, equity derivatives strategist at the New York-based bank, noted that trading volumes in US options were now almost as high as volumes on the underlying stocks, at 91 per cent. That is the highest level in at least the past 14 years, and about three times the equivalent percentage in 2016.

These co-ordinated attempts to take a stock “to the moon” does call into question whether it constitutes market manipulation.

After all, nearly every time a company’s share price collapses hurt executives, shareholders and government point the finger at a “bear attack” by evil short-sellers. Often taking legal or market measures to try and shut down the selling. But what about when a price shoots higher? Silence so far.

Question is: will the exchanges and regulators feel the need to do anything about it?

Oversight of US equities trading is a strange beast. Technically it is run by the Securities and Exchange Commission but fully-regulated exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and CBOE Global Markets have a quasi-governmental status too.

All parties are governed by the Exchange Act of 1934, and on the first page one value seems eternal:

...there is an important national interest in maintaining fair and orderly securities trading, assuring the fairness of securities transactions and markets and protecting investors.

That stipulation is in part to ensure trades are done in an economically efficient way and that there’s fair competition between all. But it’s also to ensure: “the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities.”

You could argue that a bunch of people publicly discussing their plans on a free website qualifies on that score.

However, on the “fair and orderly” stipulation, the Reddit bull attacks arguably fail the test. There isn’t anything orderly about a stock exploding just because a bunch of retail investors decide they want it to.

To what degree the swing to commission free trading in the US has helped to fuel this collective behaviour is another thing worth bearing in mind.

In that context, what can regulators do? One thing they might want to look at is who exactly is posting on these websites.

During the dotcom boom, Yahoo message-boards and AOL chat rooms were the Reddit-equivalent. But, as we found out after the fact, not everyone was an impartial observer.

Take the story of John Freeman, who in the late ‘90s worked as a temp at banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. There, he became aware of mergers and acquisitions long before they happened, which he shared with his pals online. The game was up, according to Dan Davies’ book Lying for Money, when the SEC realised a giant flow of prescient market orders for a takeover target were coming through one stockbroker in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

FT Alphaville is not suggesting the same thing is happening here — after all, these bets are placed purely, it seems, “for the lols”. But then again, what’s to stop one company insider, desperate for whatever reason to make their stock rise, faking a screenshot of a giant call option trade on the site in the hope the herd follows? Not much, we suggest.

On the face of it Reddit users don’t appear to be aware of what they’re doing. Here’s one quote from a user looking to pump Microsoft’s stock:

Also if this happens to be illegal, I don't know about it so I'm safe.

This is the internet, so who really knows anything. If the quote is genuine, FT Alphaville isn’t sure the rationale will hold a lot of water if and when officials come knocking."

CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) has been on fire as the world has been on fire due to COVID-19. This company has been doing so well this past month or so. The KEY thing here is that there are only 7...I repeat 7, Antigen tests for COVID-19 worldwide. Not in the US...worldwide. And CEMI has submitted their approval for a rapid antigen test waiting to be approved by the FDA for EUA.

Highlights of what you have missed since my last post:

* 12/2/2020: Chembio Diagnostics Awarded $12.7 Million by BARDA for Development of Rapid DPP Respiratory Antigen Panel and 510(k) Submission of the Rapid DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System
* 11/13/2020: Chembio received regulatory approval from Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA) to market the DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen System in Brazil.
* Craig Hallum upgraded CEMI as a buy today for $10 PT

That BARDA contract that they won will enable them to create a new test that looks at both Influenza A/B and COVID-19 with their DPP test.

On top of that, they have their 2 tests submitted with the FDA for EUA, the antigen and antibody test. The second those are approved, which is imminent, this thing will skyrocket.

Still long those original shares I posted at the bottom, but added 2000 additional shares on one account and 2500 on another account.

**----Previous Post on 10/16----**

Listen up here you degenerates...its time to do some due diligence on CEMI (Chembio Diagnostics) and make some sweet tendies with it. Chembio is a leading point-of-care diagnostics company focused on detecting and diagnosing infectious diseases who have recently also gotten into creating tests for COVID-19. Here is why I think they are going to skyrocket:

* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for DPP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test System - Rapid Test Provides Results in Only 20 Minutes (Submitted Oct 15, 2020) ---- BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) has given Chembio their support throughout the development of the antigen system so there is is skin in the game here.
* Chembio submitted an EUA Application for New DPP SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG Test System - New Antibody Test System Provides Results in 15 Minutes from Finger Stick, Venous Whole Blood, Plasma, or Serum Samples (Submitted Sep 8, 2020)
* Chembio just received FDA Approval for DPP HIV-Syphilis System on October 2, 2020. The system includes the DPP HIV-Syphilis assay, a multiplex single-use test, and the DPP Micro Reader optical analyzer, and is being offered in the United States immediately.

Their platform, DPP, can flex into multiple different areas, and with a recent approval for their HIV-Syphilis test, as well as they are on the fast track for approval for their COVID-19 tests, this will be huge. Now what I will say is there share price went to \~$15 when they released their COVID-19 test, but it didnt show good results so the FDA removed their test from the market and caused the shares to tank. But thats ok, because the new CEO has his head on right and will get this done in the right way, especially with the funding from BARDA.

Any partnership, any approval from the FDA, and this will skyrocket. I am long on 6000 shares @ \~$4.62.

Good luck homies and as always, do your own due diligence to get those sweet tendies.

TL;DR: CEMI target share price of $15+"

I keep seeing a lot of advice posts in here that are all great even if none of you retards are actually following that advice, but one more big piece here. I keep seeing people arguing with intense (and unearned) confidence that stock X will keep going up even though it's already gone up 559% in 6 months, stock Y (usually Tesla lol) kept going up when it was up 690% (see what I did there). But guess what fuckers, these are two different cases.

I know we're all autistic in this sub but people need to have exit strategies. You have to recognize that you've already landed on the moon. When you're sitting on a 400% gain on a very risky run-up, it's extremely unrealistic for there to be no sort of pullback *even if the long-term thesis is still intact*. People are out here playing the lottery but you already fucking hit the lottery if you hit on 400%. Guys, the average return on stocks is roughly 8% historically (when you account for inflation). 400% is like 50x that. Yeah it's cool to post 10,000% gains and shit but you know what else is cool? Walking away with a big gain and not having to be the bottom bitch to the homeless guy who you share the dumpster behind wendy's with.

Loss porns were funny but I keep seeing ""lost my life savings"" or ""gambled on significant margin"" or ""i used student loan payments for this"" and it's really bumming me out. So either start using what little brain cells you have or at least leave out the context because I want to laugh at you without feeling bad.

“Palantir Tried Buying Morgan Stanley's Stake in Value Feud

Bank’s mutual funds have repeatedly cut value of small holding
So Palantir sought to buy it back at lower price, people say
Silicon Valley startups sometimes bicker with their investors, but tensions between Peter Thiel’s Palantir Technologies Inc. and Morgan Stanley’s mutual funds are reaching a breaking point.

The banks’ funds have cut their valuation of a minor stake in the secretive data-mining company several times in the last two years, estimating the company’s worth at just $4.4 billion as of September 30. That’s well below the appraisal of several other investors in the firm and just one-ninth the valuation Morgan Stanley’s own bankers predict the company could fetch in an initial public offering.”"

Ladies and gents, it's storytime. I hope you get cookies, milk, and your PLTR jacket because I think this is a pretty good one.

**1.** It all started on 28 July when KODK got the $765M loan from the U.S. government and branch into pharmaceuticals (in addition to cameras and cryptocurency). I sent the news to dad. Because of 1) the fact that the loan was bigger than the market cap at the time and 2) some boomer nostalgia of long-lost Eastman Kodak greatness, dad immediately told us to ""BUY"" KODK.

**2.** So the next day, even while the stock went parabolic, I bought **1000 shares @ $28:**

For those who participated in this KODK pump, you remember the euphoria and gambling mania on 29 July. Stock was halted at least 5 times and each time it opened like $3-4 higher. I thought I (and dad) were pretty smart.

**3.** So of course I bought **450 more shares** (and at this point dad and sis also bought in), all the while with Mom warning us that ""stonks can't go up like this"":

**4.** Then people started saying the loan wasn't quite right, and that there was some sketchy insider trading going on. Here was the position a few days later with my now $30 average:

**5.** And it kept tanking even more:

**6.** Eventually it reached the $6 levels ($5's, even). Like a prudent investor, I DCA my way through times of trouble, thinking to myself maybe KODK is gonna build its own electric truck soon. I bought **3,550 more shares to lower my average to $17's:**

**7.** With Donald Pump going out of office, I finally decided to sell. I don't have the exact screenshot from the app but according to my IBKR PortfolioAnalyst report I sold at **$7.11:**

https://preview.redd.it/uob8vix76w261.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=76afe1ceca430f8da0bf69877a292b8be3718de1

That would put my loss at **$85,912.50 - $35,556.50 = $50,356.** Dad also liquidated at around this price but he had bought in cheaper so he didn't get too beaten up about it. Mom was really shaking her head at us with the ""I told you so's"" and that was the moment that I finally understood MOM KNOWS BEST.

===================================================================================

**BONUS MATERIAL**

**Bonus 1:** Here are some further losses on these things known as ""call options"" including where I skillfully turned $6,400 into $21:

TLDR: SPY 360 Puts 12/11  


I'm not going to lie, I tend to be a little bearish, but this looks like a great setup for a week long short. Over the last 3 trading sessions, SPY has hit the R1 resistance 3 times, but never breached it to close out the 6 hour candle. 6 hour RSI is at 66.5 (at the time of this post), which is almost at the 70 level after which it's considered overbought by all the algos.  


I believe that over the next week or so it should bounce of off the R1 and approach the pivot line (360ish level).  


This is not even considering all the stimulus talk starts and stops, which most likely won't get announced until the 11th (even if it does). So no immediate catalysts to the upside.

\`\`Upon analysis, it is clear that the Short Sellers Reports produced by the investment research companies were part of an orchestrated media attack aiming to promote short-sale-related capital gains by artificially lowering the share price of Nanox. As can be seen in the NASDAQ images below, this planned attack was successful. The share price of NNOX was favourably high prior to the release of the reports in the beginning of September 2020, and dropped significantly upon their release by Citron and Muddy Waters, and then again increased and stabilized in the end of November 2020. Furthermore, the fact that the Citron report has recently been moved into their archive provides some ancillary indication that this was, in fact, a planned short selling action \`\`

560,Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.,4557,k4ztif,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/,412,"Been awhile since I made a post educating you retards, throwing pearls before swine. I've been disheartened by some of the comments I've read recently and just wanted to provide some tips for the genuine noobies/retards among us. If you already know this shit, congrats, move along sir.

Take a look at my previous, more advanced guide to some theta gang theory for those looking for something a bit more in depth: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how\_to\_consistently\_outperform\_the\_sp500\_using/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/)

Without further ado... TOP 5 TIPS Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.

# 1) You MUST understand Implied Volatility.

I made this the first point because it is the gigantic mistake I see noobies here making again and again. I'm talking to you, people who bought calls on PLTR at $30.  **If you learn anything from this post, you MUST learn this.**

You see a stock make a massive move either up or down. Your immediate response is ""this is a great opportunity to buy calls/puts on a volatile stock!"" Right? WRONG!

In fact, when a stock has just made a massive move in either direction, that is perhaps the WORST time to purchase options in EITHER direction. Options are not stupid. Options are designed to price in the fact that a stock is moving wildly. This is called ""implied volatility."" They become more expensive as a stock makes more dramatic moves, to price in the volatility you and everyone else is expecting.

It's quite possible and even likely that you buy an option on a high IV stock, and the stock moves in your direction, and yet you LOSE money, because it didn't move as dramatically as was expected by the implied volatility. **This is called ""IV crush.""** It only takes one or two experiences with IV crush for most traders to learn this lesson for life. If you understand this concept before you lose a ton of money, all the better.

**So, what should you do if a stock is highly volatile and options are expensive due to IV?**

There are two choices: Trade actual shares, or SELL the options rather than buy them.

If you are bullish on a high IV stock, you can take a bullish position by SELLING a cash-secured put rather than buying the call. If you are bearish on a high IV stock, you can take a bearish position by SELLING a call rather than buying a put (although this entails greater risk and will typically require higher options trading level by your broker).

# 2) You MUST have patience.

It's a tale as old as time. A noobie investor does some research, reads some DD, and is convinced a stock is going to rise over the next couple years. So he buys in. A bad day or two hits and the stock tanks. He panics, and sells. The next couple days the stock rises and appears to stabilize. So he buys back in again, because he still believes in his thesis. The stock drops again, and he panic sells again.

In reality the stock is just trading sideways, but this idiot keeps buying on green days and selling on red days. This is perhaps the most idiotic, suicidal strategy anyone could ever employ. Buying on green and selling on red is a surefire strategy to lose money consistently over time.

This is why you MUST remove your emotions from your trades, because your emotions will usually tell you to buy on green and sell on red, literally buy high and sell low. As the boomer Warren Buffett once stated: **""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""**

Here is a better approach. Set up your entire trade BEFORE you make the trade. Have a set price you will sell at if things go south. Have a target price you will sell at if things go well. Once the dust settles you can learn from any mistakes. Were you too aggressive, or too conservative in your targets? What emotions directed you to make those mistakes? Too much greed, too much risk aversion, too LITTLE risk aversion? Make every trade a learning opportunity.

# 3) You MUST understand ""Reversion to the Mean.""

In general, stocks will tend to revert to their trendlines.

This thesis is fairly simple. If a stock moons 10% in a day, the most likely event is a drop the next day. If a stock tanks 10% in a day, the most likely event is a rise the next day. This is because humans are emotional creatures. First, they overreact to big news. Next, one of two things happen: When the stock is way up, people see it as a profit taking opportunity, so they sell. When the stock is way down, people see it as a buying opportunity, so they buy.

I don't have any hard data to back up this thesis, but I'm sure there's a bunch of nerds out there with hard data that proves exactly this, as well as trading algorithms specifically designed for a ""reversion to the mean"" strategy that are consistently profitable.

Obviously there will be exceptions, as well as times when a big move signals a shift in the trendline. All I am saying is in the MAJORITY of cases, reversion to the mean will occur. Don't go chasing stocks that have made massive short-term swings in a single direction unless you have strong reasons (not just hopes) to believe the trend has changed.

# 4) You MUST not YOLO your account more than once (or twice).

This is going to be controversial for some of you. But it's just straight math. If you keep betting your entire account, or close to it, on single trades, **it's only a matter of time before you go broke. That is a mathematical guarantee.**

Let's say you are one of the most skilled, intelligent, informed investors on the planet (doubtful). So skilled your plays are 90% correct. If you bet your entire portfolio on each trade, you are still expected to go completely broke after around 10 trades.

Let's say you aren't a brilliant stonk gambler. Let's say you are just average and your trades are a coin flip (which is generous for a lot of you retards). **If you bet your entire bankroll on each bet, on average you will go completely broke in just 2 trades.**

Again, there is a lot of complicated math we can go through to predict account explosion times and optimal bet sizing and so on, but that isn't necessary here. Professional gamblers such as poker players have refined bankroll management theory, which usually means at the least they aren't putting more than 10% of their cash on the table in one sitting, usually closer to 5%. (Take a look at the ""Kelley criterion"" for an interesting read: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly\_criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion))

I know a lot of you are broke with no life prospects and hoping to get rich quick. I don't fault you for that, I get it. The problem arises when you see the people who got insanely lucky with guessing 10 coin flips in a row who turned $1000 into $1,000,000, and hope to do the same... **but for every one retard with a record like that you've got hundreds more who lose it all and have nothing to show for it.**

I won't fault anyone for making a gigantic, life-changing bet a single time. That is your choice to make, and it just might pay off. But if you think you are going to do that again and again and survive, you are delusional.

# 5) You MUST be Skeptical... of EVERYTHING.

Fools and their money are soon parted. Don't be a fool.

Your first instincts when hearing ANYTHING should be skepticism. Your friend has a hot stock tip? Start with skepticism. Some online DD on a meme or penny stock online sounds convincing? Start with skepticism. A highly respected financial or government agency gives future guidance on whatever... again, start with skepticism.

There are a million people out there trying to take advantage of you, to pump and dump you, to scam you, to trick you into spending more money on whatever.

There are times when being a conformist pays off, like when markets rally for months straight. There are times when being a contrarian pays off, like when markets tank and sectors collapse. Don't be a consistent conformist nor a consistent contrarian. Be skeptical of every thesis and every hypothesis you hear, or even the ones you invent yourself.

When you take this approach honestly and still become convinced of a thesis, you have a higher probability than most of being correct.

**Seek out opinions that contradict your biases, not opinions that confirm your biases.** This is incredibly difficult and goes against human nature, but if you can achieve this ideal, you will out-trade 90% of the public.

IN other words... buy MGM, DKNG, PENN or what ever else. the amount of money that flows through these bets are crazy profitable to states and they are more than happy to let it happen.

567,PLTR mooned at 2:17 PM EST because of me,141,k5glb2,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5glb2/pltr_mooned_at_217_pm_est_because_of_me/,62,"I am enrolled in Schwab's Securities Lending Fully Paid Program. Basically they borrow your shares and loan it to people who want to short, and in return they pay you interest.

This morning Schwab notified me that they borrowed 18,300 shares. I wanted to do some option plays, but you can't since the shares are on ""loaned."" I called them up and told them to close the program.

Within 1 minute of transferring my shares back, PLTR started to go back up from the day's low of 21.50. I guess the shorters had to cover 18,300 shares?

568,SPWH will make you money - Guaranteed,9,k5uu4i,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5uu4i/spwh_will_make_you_money_guaranteed/,19,"**Introduction:** SPWH - Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings, Inc. is an outdoor sporting goods retailer. Its stores offer camping, fishing products, and hunting and shooting products. The earnings was announced yesterday and they were phenomenal. Their Q3 quarterly sales = 1/2 entire market Cap!

This one is undervalued by a lot!

The company made a gross profit of $334 million in last 3 quarters and trading at a market cap of $600 mn. It's insanely undervalued.Last 12 months revenue was more than that of SNOW ($1.2-$1.3 B) , yes, you heard it right.

The same store sales and e-commerce sales are through the roof and this trend will continue as people continue to spend outdoors, guns, shooting and camping.

**Financials:**

88% YTD to $14.3

Q3'20 YOY

Rev=$1B📈62%🔥 > demand from hunting/shooting

P/L=$62M

Same Stores Sales📈44%

E-commerce sales📈218% or 10% of Q3'20 YTD sales

Loyalty Prog=2.6M

\*Hunting participation📈122% in Michigan

FY'20 Outlook

Rev=$1.4B📈58%

EBITDA=$146M

**Opportunity:** They had a fantastic November, (up 70% as confirmed in yesterday's conference call), due to Biden win (more gun sales) and Black Friday. December and January will continue the robust trend due to holidays and unused vacation.

Q4 for sure and first half of next year, the trend is gonna continue.

**Deal:** Trading at 0.5 Price to Sales, Less than 10 PE, this is the stock Grandpa Warren Buffet advised us to buy. This is gonna print in next few days when the world finds out !

**My position:** Bought shares at $13.8

;TLDR : **Buy stock or options** depending on your risk levels. You make tendies - GUARANTEED!"

Im here today to talk to you about a company Im really hyped up about called **Momentus**.These guys are doing some really awesome shit out here providing last mile services for space transport, implementing new high-efficiency propulsion technologies for inter-planetary travel and shipping, and they’re positioning themselves to be in on the GROUND FLOOR of \*Permanent Space Infrastructure\* and the permanent space economy. These guys rule. This is the **first publicly traded space infrastructure company.**

Dont even fucking kid yourself about this: If human beings dont blow themselves into the stone ages, space is \*i n e v i t a b l e\*. We’re looking at $415Billion in revenue in the space industry currently, with Bank of America projecting the industry to expand upwards of $1.4Trillion in the near future.

As excited as I am about these guys, I’ll do what I can to give you the information I’ve been able to dig up so you can check em out and see if you're interested. I personally think they have some short term hype potential (which I’ll explain later) but Im buying calls now to lock in a price for this company to eventually exercise and hold for the full trip around the fucking moon

**Friends First: Momentus Confirmed Partners**

Currently, Momentus has confirmed and active partnerships or provides services to NASA, Lockheed Martin, and our favorite billionaire meme-lord papa Elon via Space X. They are already confirmed to be participating in the (hopefully) January 14th 2021 first-ever ride share rocket launch in partnership with Space X. They’re launching 4 different times with Space X in 2021 including an already-booked full vehicle in December of 2021 so they are already out there making plans and getting shit moving. Besides these big names there are many others they have current accounts and partnerships with including Global Ground Station, Relativity, Albaorbital, and others. And just as a little sugar on top, [the President of SpaceX prefers the types of space-tugs offered by Momentus over small rockets](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spacex-president-prefers-space-tugs-over-small-rockets-2020-11-18) (wouldnt mind em giving me a lil space tug myself ifyanowutimsayin)

**The Men Behind the Mission**

The president and founder of Momentus is a man named Mikhail Kokorich. This guy was born in Siberia and studied physics in Russia where he finished his degree with honors while simultaneously starting a company. He has formed and headed several successful companies starting at age 19 with one that provided explosives and chemical services to Siberian mining companies. After that he founded and ran a chain of domestic merchandise retail stores, second in size only to Bed Bath & Beyond, successfully scaled and sold one of the largest consumer electronic retail chains as well as one of the biggest timber companies in the world.. He finally moved back to his childhood dream of building a space company. The rest of their team includes people with previous experience in aerospace, propulsion, and robotics as well as others. Plus, Mikhail is Russian and they beat the US into space so he’s already got a leg up. Also, Chris Hadfield (the astronaut that did an autistic David Bowie cover from the ISS) is on their Board of Directors, so thats pretty cool.

**The Company, The Vision, The Mission**

Momentus as a company currently has customers for space transportation services including last mile delivery, payload services that will decrease the costs across the board for launching and developing satellites, as well as fixing those puppies up and refueling them \*while they’re in orbit\*. They have a proven groundbreaking water propulsion technology that is significantly cheaper than any current offerings, is reusable, and is already working since a successful test flight in mid-2019 thats still going to this day. **No pushing the satellite down a hill and turning the camera bullshit here.** They put their money where their mouth is and shot that fucker into space just to prove they could, and its **still going.** Currently they have >$90M of signed contracts and 4 confirmed Vigoride (thats what they’ve named their first model) launches on Space X Flacon-9s. They already have a product roadmap with 3 different models to be offered by 2024 providing both small satellite all the way up to 20,000kg transportation. They will have limited commercial launches starting in the first half of 2021 with full commercial launches going live by Q4 2021. They are compatible with Space X, Blue Origin, GK Launch Services, and Relativity with active launch deals signed with all except Blue Origin currently. They’re also in negotiations for over $1.1B of contracts including with NASA and the US government. Companies like Starlink, Amazon, Apple, and Google already have plans to create their own satellite networks and Momentus is the first in line with proven technology to service all of these future plans with big and long lasting tech players. They have a clear path to profitability and >$1B in EBITDA. Lastly, they’re already looking to the future and working on plans for in-space solar energy generation, water and resource harvesting from asteroids and other planetary bodies, as well as all sorts of other cool sci-fi shit that (I hope) humans will be capable of before Im fucking dead.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**Momentus is a bleeding-edge space infrastructure and technology company with a successful and passionate founder, a proven currently-in-space revolutionary water propulsion technology, active partnerships with Space X, NASA, and others, and already have good finances and a clear path to profitability and growth. They’re going public via a special purpose acquisition company with an enterprise value of $1.2B which will later be relisted under the ticker $MNTS.

Momentus was founded by a Russian (the first country in space), already has working partnerships with Papa Elon, and wants to build a future where getting to and moving around in space is cheap, renewable, and profitable. This guys are [going to the fucking moon and back several times on a tiny, water-propellled 🚀 with or without you](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201201005408/en/Momentus-Announces-First-Rideshare-Mission-to-Moon), so I’d suggest you grab a seat early and hold on tight

**Positions1/21 20c and 25c (ticker-rename and first Space X launch hype)**

**2/21 20c (to lock in my price, exercise and hold)**

edit\* Apparently gay mods hate good DD, $1.2bn enterprise value mergers, and the entire possibility for human beings to permanently inhabit space cause they banned the current ticker. Its confirmed for January and it'll be MNTS then but right now you'll have to just google Momentus SPAC"
