His glass eye open wide with rage as he batters TSLA relentlessly.

"The valuation..." *crunch* "makes...." *crunch* "NO.... " *crunch* "SENSE!" he roars with maniacal autistic glee.

TSLA struggles for the edge of the ring, but coughs blood as each hit lands, and eventually stops moving. Bear King Burry drops the chair.

*Bear King Burry turns to the crowd*

"Was this your champion!? Was TSLA supposed to be your *chosen one!?*"

*A child in the crowd turns his face into his mother's side and cries.*

On the side of the ring WSB can barely move. TSLA was supposed to tag them in, but couldn't make it to the side in time.

"Get up TSLA" WSB whimpers hopelessly, a single tear rolling down their cheek. "Get up..."

*Bear King Burry turns to WSB*

"Now it is your portfolio's turn. Get in here you little bitch."

"Excuse me." Someone replies from behind BKB. "I believe I can give you the fight you want."

A robed figure is administering smelling salts to TSLA. The figure puts TSLA on its shoulder and carries TSLA gently out of the ring.

"And just who the fuck do you think you are?" BKB rumbles ominously. 

BKB's fingers squeeze so tightly on the chair that metal bends.

"Who am I?" the robed figure inquires.

*The robed figure stands straight and stretches to their full height. They must be at least 7' tall.*

The crowd stops crying and watches in stunned silence.

"Who am I?" The figure repeats menacingly.

*The figure turns around to face BKB, ripping off his robe. A gleaming light fills the stadium. Before us stands a Golden deity, rippling with muscle. If there is an ounce of body fat it is currently in hiding, only to make way for seemingly endless coiled golden musculature.*

The figure looks directly into Bear King Burry's eyes.

"I'm Goldman Sachs, and i'm here to kill you."I can see the headline next week

Also: Fuck you PLTR bears. Literally dumb dumb ty for gainsWe out here 🐝PLTR stimulus talks going wellI have the uncanny ability to turn $500 into $36 almost weeklyPLTR top candidate for Germany contract.

$250+Picture this:

It’s June, you’re unemployed cause rona but just made your salary for the summer in 3 days on airline calls. And that unemployment be printing. You’re sitting outside with nothing to do, just lazily working on your project car as you listen to the radio. Drinking a sweet tea. Morgan Wallen’s “Chasin you” is playing. It’s 80 degrees and sunny out with a nice breeze. The lockdown has just been lifted and life is good.

Now picture it’s December and you live in Michigan (absolutely shit outside rn if you don’t know). You lost all the airline money and more chasing that rush and your portfolio looks like a dying EKG. You’re still in bed because you’re getting hammered by seasonal depression and not being able to go out cause of lockdown 2. You’re too scared to make a big play but too scared to miss out on returns so you scalp and hate yourself for selling winners short. You’re back to work and school and it sucks dick doing both remotely. 

Damn bros I ain’t offing myself or nothing but it’s crazy how life swings. Maybe that’s why we can handle the swings in our portfolio without batting an eye 🤔"How long do you think PLTR will hit 30?"

"Could be 3, or 4"

"3 or 4 what? Days? Weeks? Months?"

"Maybe 5"Senator Purdue made 2600 trades in his first term, more than the next top 5 senators.

#THIS IS PETER THIELS CAWK RNLook at little socialist New Zealand getting a 4-day work week even though they’re not actually socialist, they have a freer market than we do. Meaning they don’t bail out the rich fuckers holding oil when oil goes negative and don’t tell bulls not to kill themselves when things go tits up, they tell them to get the fuck over it.Remember, the only people bullish on NIO are the ones trapped in a position. If this comment gets downvoted to shit, I’m right lolThank god I opted not to buy TSLA puts yesterday. This stock is an animal.Where's my PLTR gang at!?CRSR better wake the hell up todayIs it normal to have dreams about the market and about the rh screen?Good morning everyone. I hope for you all to make those gains today.Looking forward to NKLA getting delisted so everyone can stop lumping HYLN in with NKLA as well.. seriously look at the fucking correlation since merger.. everyone: NKLA fraud must mean HYLN fraud because they're both into semi's..CRM!!!!! LFGOOOOAll hail ELon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He is KingMy crystal ball says $PLTR Run up to 24-25 today.  Drop to 20 by eow.  I'm selling at the top today and buying back in on Friday.Why is it that every time I over leverage myself to get my portfolio to the next level, it doesn't pan out and I have to work myself back up slowly?How are we feeling about NIO rn with this massive green candle?rip my pltr puts i bought yesterday 🤡I just want confirmation that FOMO TESLA calls will print. When are we hitting 700?Lol I used to lose sleep over losing 500 dollars in one day. Yesterday I saw my PLTR call lose 2k in an hour and literally went back to bed. Of course I’m still holding you fucking pussiesAm I reading this wrong or did jobless claims 10 bag week over week 😳. I know my selfish ass wants the markets to pump but also please don’t let ppl starve when all you gotta do is vote smhHello basement dwellersCRSR hitting 40 today?? 👀CRM❗️❗️🚀
