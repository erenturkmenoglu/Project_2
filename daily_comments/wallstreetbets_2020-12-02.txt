This past weekend i saw a friend i haven’t seen since quarantine started. We get to talking about the stanks, and he’s like “oh dude have you tried dividend investing? You just hold shares and it’s like residual income.” I didn’t know how to explain that i have 22k in monthly GME calls so i just smiled and said “dude yeah dividends are sick.” This is my burden to bear, not his.CONGRATS u RETARD, u made front page:

That's how you know IV is getting killed out thereNow that guy won't be able to leave his abusive relationshipYou put out your seventh cigarette of the morning in the Luckin Coffee cup sitting by the monitor. The red, jagged lines slicing across your screen have you on edge. You need some air.

You stand up and grab your keys. The plastic green-lettered Hertz keychain rests in your palm. You smile. You stole this car from a rental car lot, and no one noticed. Or maybe it’s just that no one cared.

You slip on a black GameStop t-shirt, part of the uniform to the only job you ever had. You weren’t fired. The place closed and had to let everyone go. It turns out there’s no market for used mid-2000s Madden NFL discs.

As you step out of your bunker into the sunlight, you blink rapidly. When was the last time you went outside?

“Don’t move!”

As your vision clears, you see armed men in black vests surrounding you. Most vests read FBI. A few read SEC. “How’d you find me?”

A guy in an SEC vest spits out a word you never want to hear—your biggest loser ever. “Palantir.”When your entire portfolio is on EV and SPACS 😅😂😭S&P at ATH

They’re literally worth zero dollars right now lmao. I’ll drag my dick through glass if tomorrow and Thursday are green and I actually make money on this hahaI sold all my NIO shares, so expect NIO prices to go to the end of the universe.

No need to thank me...Looks like little billy isn’t getting a Christmas present from me this yearremember when PLTR was $28 for one brief, glorious minute this morning.

things were simpler then....im so bad at thisTrading with WSB can be easy and pretty profitable if you are willing to be half Boomer and half Autist:

1) find a ticker that's about to meme
2) get in with Boomer shares, leaps, or some calls that won't theta fuck you
3) let you position ride 10-30%
4) it it doesn't, GTFO and wait for the next one to come along
5) GTFO before earnings, citron strikes, stimulus fails, etc. 
6) don't get salty about the dudes who made it a 10 bagger but instead be glad you didn't let the position blow up your account
7) realize the annual gains of r/investing in one trade
8) repeatThat’s strange my strategy of throwing a dart at a stock didn’t work today 🤔bears:  extreme greed at 91 levels not seen since february, dix at 36.7 we are setting up for a huge drop

It’s not like it’s a fucking rule you have to constantly go all in on meme stocks after they’ve tripled in two weeks.If PLTR ends the week > 33.33, I will get a WSB tattoo somewhere on my armi just wanted to see a guy eat his own shit 😔If PLTR hits $29 by EOW I'll buy everyone that buys 100+ shares, screenshots for proof, and then replies with that screenshot, any car of their choice.WHY DOESNT ROBINHOOD HAVE A “SELL EVERYTHING” BUTTON?!?!Imagine being a boomer and selling your shares in Coke and buying up Palantir last Friday just because your grandson did like 5 minutes of research and showed you The Matrix.

With the shady revolving door that is Washington, the fact that they already have an in means that symbiotic/parasitic relationship will only grow with time. Options scare me, so I've just been buying shares, and I'll probably hold until there's either a dip or I remotely figure out what the fuck I'm doing.

Plus, Daddy Karpe is the Overlord Autist, whose off road rollerblading toes I'm not worthy to suck. That alone makes riding the PLTR plane worth it.

Great day!Ok, I'll admit, I deserved the severe ass pounding today. Got too cocky from almost a month of straight gains in November. I've come down to earth a bit, but I'm pretty sure I'll forget all the lessons I learned today and FOMO into something stupid in a couple days.Who was more cocky:
(A) Trump supporters in the election thread on the first night, after he won Florida and Texas. Or

(B) PLTR call holders last weeklooks like that one bear managed to breed and the children bears are now spamming DIX. nice try. december is for tendies.I love WeBulls charts. So much clarity in my losses.PLTR is dead long live PLTRbulls eating $100 sushi rolls off their girlfriends ass

Dumb as rocks lmaoHalf the stocks we hold moon or dump unrelated  to the indexes. Fuck the indexesMM realized we were going to force a squeeze on GME so they crashed all our other meme stocks to trigger their own squeezeSeeing all of the gain and loss porn on here has really driven it into my head that one yolo can seriously make or break your financial status and could lead to the most difficult times or the best of times. Exciting yet scary, because at the end of the day who knows what’s gonna happen in the market.......


Totally unrelated, anyone wanna buy 80 contracts of PLTR 35c expiring this Friday???Stonk goes down $1-2 **AH** and WSB loses their fucking mind.

Calls on Nio/Li/Xpevhope today is not the start of a pattern lol. if we can't beat the broad-based indices, we might as well join the boomer cucks at r/investing. an existence worse than death 😞[deleted]Damn. I don't know. I think I'm done. Been trying to break even all year. Actually made it back in the first week of June, but then everything came crashing down and I dropped straight back down within a couple days. I just cycle back and forth between making money and losing money, but the problem is I lose much more money than I make. Had some hope I could break even by the end of the year, but it looks like it's not happening. This FCEL offering was basically the last blow. All my gains from the last couple weeks are gone, and I'm in a deeper hole than I was before.

Left, who was under investigation by the SEC for suspected securities fraud, was responsible for recent declines in popular retail investor stocks such as Nio and Palantir.  Authorities have not yet determined the cause of death but believe that Left may have been given a “hot dose” of cocaine laced with fentanyl, most likely by a prostitute.  r/wallstreetbets could not be reached for comment.”Citron 1 WSB 0Never been much of a weed guy but I went and got a vape and have been getting baked all day for like a weekstonkI’m convinced the only way to succeed is to do the exact opposite of what you see in hereFang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, sounded a positive note on resolving the issue at a panel discussion this month, saying it’s important to ensure that Chinese companies have access to international capital markets.

View daily trending tickers on r/RedditTickers.What do we think Tesla will open at tomorrow 👀Vote for your quote of the year, the nominations are : -Stock price too high imo, by Elon Musk -We print it digitally, by Jpow -Stimulus talk going well, followed by vaccine pump, Orange man -15 days to flatten the curve, Daddy Faucci -I won this election by a lot, Orange man

Edit : Stop the count, by Orange man again has been added !Anyone in on NIO calls?On 5/1/2020 Elon tweeted that Tesla's stock price is too high. Seven months later it's up 317% from his tweet.

Today Elon once again mentions Tesla's stock indicating that the stock will plunge if they are not cost conscious.

The signal is clear. Elon yaps about stock, investors shrug it off. See you in seven months. 1855Tomorrow green day for SPACs please my portfolio is bleedingCan anyone explain what the fuck happened today lolThey gonna sell the market off soon
