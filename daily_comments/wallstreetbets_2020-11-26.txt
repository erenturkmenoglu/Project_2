The price currently says: 27.40. I am assuming that is in Euro's? The current exchange rate is 1Euro : 1.18 USD.

27.40 x 1.18 = 32.096. So PLTR is up to 32?

We used to talk about how to hedge for the next market crash, how much gold/bonds to buy to diversify, long-dated puts to counteract the any irrational rallies.

This is r/homosexualfinance isn't it? Where am I?This is serious. I just told my wife to pass on the palantir sauce 🤦🏼‍♂️Anyone who is currently holding naked OTM 11/27 puts (that arent a hedge) needs to see this message: 

Stop trading and stop igniting your money with puts. Just cause something "goes up to much" doesnt mean it has to come back down. Understand why everything has gone up (see what the fed did in march) and youll figure out why we're constantly near ATH's.

I had a friend yesterday buy TSLA 11/27 TSLA puts and QQQ puts despite me telling him not to numerous times and this fuckhead says "I just needed the cash for a swing position". Yeah he made himself broke w/ puts and still cant stop buying puts.

Oh and your 11/27 puts are fucked.THE MARKET IS CLOSED??? ON A FUCKING THURSDAY? WTF AMERIKKKAu/CptTonyStark is the type of guy who shows up to thanksgiving dinner without even bringing a side. He then drinks all your beer and eats all your turkey
