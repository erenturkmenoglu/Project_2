Our calls, Who art in PLTR,

Perfect be Thy Timing.

Thy tendies come.

Thy expirations be done,

​

Give us this day our daily Lambos.

And forgive us of our puts,

as we forgive those who buy puts against us.

And lead us not into Debt,

but deliver us unto tendies. AmenDoorDash is a great way to pay $20 for a $10 mealWho bought the PLTR dip on Friday?GME rippin

NKLA: The EV maker lost the contract to pave former CEO Trevor Milton’s driveway, reducing revenues by 100%.

PSTH: The blank-check SPAC is up 8% because sources say “why the fuck not?”

PLTR: Insiders have indicated the company has decided to stop mooning everyday and instead raise by a quiet 3% weekly until it gets re-recognized as a meme at $100 when it’s too late to make any profit on it.TSLA should buy NKLA and turn it into a energy drinks & snacks company.Buying more pltr at opening!
