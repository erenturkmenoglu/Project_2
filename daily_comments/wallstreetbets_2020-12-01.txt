#NKLA TO $5Get rekt ZMZM just fucked merip zm#FUCKZM holders, Sorry but this was seen coming from a mile awaypump is back on.  mitch even said he wants to do stimulus before winter recess.$ZM beats and it craters. As expected in this earnings seasonCrying because $7k just went up in smoke after zoom dumped after hours. Fuck buying calls for earningsare my tesla calls fuckedThe only ZM calls I will be taking tomorrow are with my coworkersHot take zoom earnings were kinda decent thoThe only way to sustain moves similar to what PLTR has done in the past 4 weeks is to keep the party going. When it’s pumping, there’s no way to tell how high it will go, or how rich you can get with OTM calls. Once the music stops, though, it’s like when all the cocaine at a party runs out. Everyone has the worst coming-down experience ever, and gets cranky as fuck.

PLTR didn’t dump that bad today. Only about 2%. PLTR autist permabulls didn’t get their crack fix, though. You can already see in the daily that they’re starting to eye GME, or APHA, or some other shiny prize.

If PLTR isn’t back at ATH by Wednesday at open, **we see $23 before EOW**. It won’t be because of bad news or a generalized crash… it’ll just be because everyone has gone elsewhere to chase their dragon.amd does the opposite of my plays every time I love itYou know teslas gonna be crazy tomorrow off that close todayJesus zoom got hot with the ole sell the newsDid ZM miss bad or something? FTzla puts!Smoke weed erryday.
