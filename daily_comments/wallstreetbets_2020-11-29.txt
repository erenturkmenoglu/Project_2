Alright, all the filter updates for tonight have gone through.

There's also been an update as to what gets stickied, so the bar for quality DD is much, much, higher now. 

As always, please let us know how you find these changes via [modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets&subject=Opinion%20on%20the%20Automod%20Latest%20Changes). We're also happy to hear any well-thought out suggestions for improving the sub, or criticisms you may have.I hope you all become richWSB should buy up every house in Andrew Left’s neighborhood and convert to low income housing so that Andrew’s house is worth 50% less so he can see what it’s like to have his equity attackedI feel like it’s been Friday for three daysWSB has taught me to feel nothing on the red days. Today's PLTR dip was child's play compared to some of the stuff we had to endure this yearYou guys need to chill. We got spoiled by PLTR going 20+% for 3 days straight, of course the 🚀 needs to refuel. If the cost for 3 20+% days is one -5%, I will happily take it.Citron usually downgrades a stock when those greedy fucks are missing out on profits. So they tank it, get enough positions in, and hold it long-term.

&#x200B;

PLTR reaching 35+ this upcoming week anyway.Imagine if you started your trading career these past few weeks and think it’s the easiest game in the worldAndrew Left claps when the plane landsFuck cancer man, seeing my dad for the first time since he was diagnosed back in August and it fucking blows to see him in this condition. Hopefully I make decent coin on these GME shares so I can gain some artificial happinessAnyone else get into risky positions and literally get nothing done at work, just refreshing your account value every 30 seconds?Keep pumping PLTRHow much of this weeks pltr gains are directly from this sub? Can we unionize and get a board seat?Making a Citron vs WSB movie when I get home. Gonna be epicFuck, really hurting from today’s 5% rug pull on PLTR. Now I’m only up 350% on my position 😔 Those gay bears showed me the error of my waysMade the mistake of letting my wife see my PLTR gains today.

Her black Friday shopping hurt me way more than today's dip.

How can I find her a boyfriend so she'll leave me alone?My portfolio is down 50% cause of PLTR, Monday it will be up 200% because of PLTR 🌝me on reddit: LOL those puts never will never print you autist, get fuk gay bear loser 🤡🤡

vs

me on resume: Provide clients with constructive criticisms & advice to reshape their portfolio to maximize returns while minimizing risk.Holy shit dude my account went from $62K to $200 the last 2 weeks...and no I wasn't ONLY a gay bear. I lost atleast $10K a piece on PLTR today and XPEV earlier. Literally the day I buy in it finally drops. Inverse me and become rich, cause I literally lost 15 plays in a rowSo here’s why PLTR will be a trillion dollar company by DecemberThe year is 2077, you and your family are having a BYND soy turkey substitute with tempeh stuffing for dinner at MCDBKWND.

You live in your parents 6x6 Zillow basement at 77 years old and still work at an AMZN warehouse as a sex slave. This is your one vacation day allotted for 5 years.

Your investment in Dow Jones went bankrupt as the DJIA is still struggling to cross 30k. Your friends who invested in Dow Jiang, the Chinese version of the dow are now retired and drive NIOs.

TSLA is now a country in Mars and you spend your time daydreaming about being a colonist as you're driving to work in a 2030 XPEV. It is custom painted with the WSB logo, license plate reading "BULZ R FUK"

However in order to day trip thru the solar system, Space X requires a minimum portfolio balance of $25,000. Per the law of Elon, circa 2050.

You boot up your portfolio on Robinhood2 using your iPhone 6s plus even though Apple had gone out of business in 2025 when the UN outlawed the wheel for environmental reasons. Sign is visible at their abandoned headquarters in California reading: "Theta this now you fucking piece of shit". Goodyear blimp crash landed and still somehow burning in the parking lot.

You attempt to connect to the restaurant's wifi since Starlink took their services offline in North America after an antitrust suit by the Republic of Exxon Mobil, formally known as Texas. They are the only state that still uses gasoline even after it was confirmed that vaping petrol causes mild insomnia.

Your account balance reads -$89.51. And a margin call message appears in your inbox. "Please stop sending Pesos in an envelope when you make a deposit. Furthermore, We will no longer be able to receive kidneys as form of payment. Sorry for the inconvenience"

You once again average down on your PLTR $10000P 11/27/77 hoping for a gap down. Andrew Left's post on Tiktok justified your DD. It was either that or THC🐝 who were still trying to acquire energizer batteries (close race between them and Oracle/Walmart)

The market opens and PLTR tanks after the news that they will buy out Google. A stock deal like that could mean millions of issued shares.

Alex Karp and Mr. Peanut brings out a fat stack of Turkish Lira and a tanker full of diesel and trades it for boomer ass GOOGL like it was a Roblox card. PLTR closes at $10001 making sure that your puts expire worthless.

On the way to LOW for some ROPE, you are hit by a rogue NKLA going downhill. You haven't seen one of those since 2020. The year you could have loaded up on PLTR calls when it was trading for $28 on the New York Stock Exchange. You die cursing George Soros as your shitty XPEV drives itself back to the dealership for missing payments.Monday? Hah more like MOONday! 🚀

Fuck you Andrew LeftMy account is up 225% in the last 2.5 weeks

It is also down 30% all time

Also fuck citron. We will retaliate somehow 🖕❤️🧡💛💚💙🐻Holy fuck dude.

No trading on Thursday half day today now 2 days off? This shit retarded. Open the markets alreadyI’ve been looking into these TikTok and YouTube groups that have been buying up mansions in LA. They’re all like fucking 16 and probably are getting way more pussy than any of us. Does anyone want to pitch in on a WSB house in LA? I’ll contribute like a rack or 2.Imagine telling your family to buy PLTR on thanksgivingGay bears 🏳️‍🌈🐻 got WAP

Whack ass positions 🤡💩If it were up to the folks here, Citron will be declared as terrorist. You newbies have no idea, what TSLA went through.This week I went from $755 to $8,100. NiceToo many people getting married to these stocks and not married to this moneyWEEKEND DOW BLOOD RED

What they do is straight market manipulation.  The decent honest people here at WSB would never engage in stuff like that. 😤  I know for sure that no one here would ever photoshop a false NIO earnings report showing big losses.  I also know that no one here would then pretend to believe it and then hype it up trying to drive the price down at open so we could all get in cheaper.  That is not the type of people that we are.  We are not scum like those amoral fucks at Citron.Got in PLTR at 32.6, proceeded to drop like a brick 🤡Where is Citron located? I want to move there, find a job nearby its offices and take a shit on its door step every chance I getAre you really telling me I have to wait until fucking Monday to see the next chapter of PLTR sznTwo possibilities:

1. We're nearing the top of the 2020 Robinhood Bubble

2. Degenerates all over the country realized that options are the best way to gamble, and stock prices will never return to what they used to be

I have no idea what's going to happenFound out my mom had 200k in Amazon in 2003 and sold 🤣🔫u/harceapsat is a scammer, saying he’ll pay you $100 if you follow his Twitter account: @Plumpeo

my whole family are a bunch of retards, no wonder I hang out hereYou know your a retard when you are up 600% for the year and still feel like you totally missed all your opportunities to make money.All jokes aside, one of the worst feelings is having people you care about not feel the same way. It sucks to have gone out of your way for people, when those people don't appreciate it in the slightest.bruh tomorrow feels like it should be mondayI've come to the conclusion that a life of mediocrity is a life not worth living. I really need a new set of friends who have aspirations of bettering themselves financially and I don't mean starting a fucking acorn account.How degenerate are we to be spending a fucking Friday night talking about stocks and shit when the market isn’t even open til Monday. This is so fucking retarded I love it.

People coming to this sub looking for actual advice should realize that we are gambling away a couple thousand that we won't miss. Save your paycheck if you can't make rent without it.

But also, if you're betting your life savings on 0DTE SPY calls, you've come to the right place.Anyone else go on wsb religiously for a couple weeks straight then take a few months break then go back to wsb religiously and repeat?I made 10k today and I'm eating a 10 piece meal from McDonalds  wtf is wrong with my life.We are going all-in on Tuscon Holdings soon....right?Breaking news: Andrew left confirmed terrorist and animal rapist. Please spread the news so others can know to ignore everything he says.What is my perfect crime? I break into TSLA at midnight. Do I go for the Teslaquila? No, I go for the Roadster. It's priceless. As I'm taking it out, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's X Æ A-12. I say no. Me and Elon make love all night. In the morning, the SEC comes and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell Elon and my autist friends to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust them. Besides, PLTR knew where I was the entire time. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of CHASDAQ. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Elon to meet me at Giga Berlin in Germany. He’s been waiting for me all these years. He’s never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to autistland itself, deep in the realm of Reddit. That's where I stashed the roadster.

Moral of the story? PLTR & TSLA to the fucking moon. Free shuttle on Dragon One. Going way up. Way. Up.Accidentally found an old classmates OF account being advertised... i had math with her in high school.

What the fuck manI need to surround myself with smart and reckless peopleSort of curious, who has been on this sub for over a year?Only ogs on right nowThe only thing that makes me nervous about PLTR is all you teenage retards that freak out about a -2% day after a 100% run up in a week...How is jake Paul even in the same building as mike Tyson?Genuinely, this sub changed my life and I love you retards


20 yr old college student, and I completely YOLOd the refunds I got for an overaward on my student loan payouts for my financial aid. Had 18k of student loan debt, and 23k in my account when I found the sub.

Fuck citronCitron failed to mention their predicted 5:1 split on PLTR. So really they're aiming at $100. Just a miscommunication.Even though I made a lot of money the past 2 weeks, it doesn't feel like nearly enough of a cushion for when they switch back to hard modetalked to my grandma about stocks earlier since she’s invested in it and likes to do her best to keep up with the market. showed her some of the profitable plays i had this month and she was so proud that i didn’t have the heart to tell her my portfolio is still negative from shit plays in october. i love you nana i’ll climb myself fully out of this hole soon 😭So when I started omg I can make 200 a week, this is life changing!

APHA gang 🚀🚀🚀🚀Just scrolled through another [Reddit post](https://reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/k1vhb6/how_many_of_you_have_at_least_10k_in_savings/) titled “how many of you have at least 10k in savings?”

I couldn’t handle everyone circlejerking over how poor they are despite making terrible financial decisions, so I had to come back to wsb ASAP. At least everyone here knows they’re retarded.

EDIT: added linkPLTR did not fall! What are you guys talking about? After a 165% run in 1 month PLTR only dropped less than 4% Friday with Citron talking shit. Can't believe how cocky PLTR bears are with that as their victory.Fuck man reopen the markets, I just want to do hood rat shit with my autistic friendsSo one of my cousins has been in a Mental Institution for a few years now and occasionally I visit to see how's he doing. Frankly, he walks and talks like a normal person, so I wonder what's wrong with him to be locked up here? Then he said "GME will hit $500+ on a squeeze" and then I realized he belongs here with the other delusional GME bulls.So my car caught on fire... I’m watching police and firemen put it out. What a morning...Is a "Four Seasons Total Landscaping" coffee mug a good gift for liberal family members? They'll find it funny?Still balls deep on PLTR 12/24 $30c. Diamond hands.Who is in on GME? Is this infinity squeeze legit? It seems like it, but also feels too good to be true?Mods, do fucking something about the GME spam.

At least until it's as lit as PLTR, lmao.GME gonna fuck double this weekI think I understand the market now, if you hold to long it will expire worthless, if you don’t hold long enough you’ll miss out on gains. If you don’t buy at all it will go to the moon.[removed]Petition to change “circuit breaker” to “Nate Robinson”rip that guy who said he put $5k on Roy jones because "ez money" then deleted it 5 mins later[deleted]These dudes really rigged an exhibitionPeople really pay $250/month just for a trading discord chat...Fuck I’m ready for Monday already.When Palantir dipped I bought at 30 and as it kept going down I almost panic sold until I realized it was those dumbasses at citron’s fault and it was actually bullishHow did anyone lose money on pltr  thats incrediblePLTR with just a 2% pullback

Let's show BABA some love next week and get this bread 🤤🚀🚀🚀🚀I’m still thinking about the dude who has 2m in NIO calls and won’t sell because taxes. Literally moving states to eeek out a little more. Had to sell some because he needed $300 for bills. It’s like ascended ‘tism.

I’ll have you guys know i diamond handed my 1/15/21 $16 calls from -80% and I just broke even on them on Friday 🥰🥰Between GME and PLTR being constantly mentioned here, this sub is either going to be very happy or very sad soon.Does anyone ever goes through moments where they just could careless about pussy?

I dont think we're friends anymore.Hey guys, Andrew Left of Citron Research ^^TM here.  Just wanted to pop by and see if you guys took my advice?  The stock market is not a casino and you should all sell your PLTR now when you still have a chance.  
  
  
Just kidding I'm a massive cuck and just wanted to buy in under 30 before it moons.Imagine if all stock trading was still done on the floor and WSB was just all of us retards huddled in a corner talking shit\*digs his old "T$LA 1,000" hat out of the closet and puts it on\*Can mike Tyson give a PLTR shoutout?Im watching The Big Short, and holy fuck, these guys have fucking diamond hands.Lol this result fucked over so many peopleI can’t wait to hear DKNG earnings calls with all the “surprising” profit they made this quarter.This sub ruined my weekend. Actually have time off with my wife to enjoy the nice weather and I can't stop thinking about GME and what color my tesla is going to be.Mike Tyson fight tomorrow the year is 2020Boys, iran tensions or lemon fucks, PLTR rocket will rise.My local news station is called WSB-TVImagine all the autists convincing their loved ones over the holidays to buy PLTR this morning 💀Andrew Left deducted money from his local foodbankAndrew Left listens to Nickelback at the highest possible volume when he’s in the car.Andrew Left lost his virginity to a catOK I have 4000 shares of TCH BBcakes, someone tell me how likely this merger is and what this extension is all about.   


Buy first, ask questions later.Sincere lack of GME pump in this thread#  Andrew Left is gayAndrew Left is the type of guy to open up a Dr Pepper in the grocery store take a drink and then put it back.Wife just had a screaming match with my in laws over politics, but I made some good cash on FUBO today so its net positive.I'm ball deep in a bad 🐝itch, and ooo she thiccMy friend has a million dollars in TSLA.  I have $0.  Therefore that fucking stock is going to continue to go up 20% per week in perpetuity.Can you install Robinhood on the ps5?Palantir: “if you can’t handle me at my worst you don’t deserve me at my best”

Me: “I love you baby”Anyone else buy LEAPS and then immediately cash out after the first big green day?I’m long on McDonald’s and Johnson & Johnson. Americans getting bigger and bigger and need to apply BENGAY on their sore knees from carrying 300 pounds of McRibs all day.Alright I can't sleep so I'll explain my autistic trading method. I can't post this on other subs, they'll think I'm retarded. I call it churning the tendies method.

Hold a base position in a meme stonk (AMD is my choice due to my Lord and Savior being Mama Su and also the good premiums). Sell weekly premiums and use that to build hedges with 45DTE+ way OTM puts. Buy 45DTE+ calls just $1-$2 OTM. I chose 45DTE to avoid the rapid <30DTE theta decay. Close them out when they go ITM in the first 15 days and close out your hedge-puts. Use the profits to buy SPY shares and accumulate. This allows you to also sell premiums on SPY 3 times a week when you gather 100 shares. Never sell any shares. Use those premiums to YOLO. I personally use it to day trade 0DTE options on SPY or end of day gamma lottos on OPEX days. Rinse and repeat.ANyone else just tell their trading platform they had years of options trading experince so they could trade options?Citron did 9/11Its 2 AM, why am i still up reading the comments like a degenerate... is this addiction?From Nov 19th - now, I’m up 974%. I’m fr about to cryAll I know is someone had a family gathering before opening to explain what PLTR was.

“Look ma it’s raising! It’s free money, BUY NOW BEFORE IT HITS 40.”

“Harold quick, he might be on to something!”

*stock rises a dollar* “OH MY GOD HAROLD! We were wrong, our son is a genius. We can buy that house we always wanted!”

*Little Timmy smirks* “It’s only going up! That’s what the mathematicians and scientists at WSB are saying.”

“Well, we’re making money so far! I believe that we all have that one moment in life that changes everything. Honey, I’m putting our entire savings in!” *hits buy*

*30 seconds later stock plummets -4%*I don’t think I’ve ever been depressed before until now. I have been homeless, a drug addict with nothing, yet I still didn’t feel sorry for myself. Right now I have a stable job (luckier than most), and I have more money than I’ve ever had before in my life thanks to you guys. This last year has just been downhill, my job has lost a sense of purpose for me and I have little motivation, no real sense of purpose or drive anymore. I don’t know what I want to do with my life anymore. My girlfriend of 2.5 years made the decision to leave me, I was just so blind that I was steadily losing her. I have never felt so alone in this world before, and I don’t know what to do. My family is scattered all over and right now I live in fucking Alaska, and the 6 hours and decreasing amount of daylight probably isn’t helping. Any recommendations or insight guys? I’m 26 and I have never felt this way before, I was always full of drive and purpose and life, and now I just feel dead and empty inside. The little joy I get now is really trading (when I’m making money) and playing the piano.TSLA 🌝monday gonna be greeeeeeeeeeen AF.Hope y’all bought that CRSR dip. Holy fuck so much money gonna be made. We going back to mooning every day.I’ve almost won Nut Daily NovemberPLTR is like investing in the Death Star but whattya gonna doCheers to THC🅱️ gang 🍻🍻TΗCB GME APΧT and already looking into yachtsRemember the fun days of "bears are fuk". Now the bears are all dead, RIPI’ve gotten to the point where this isn’t even about making money any more, I just want to see the number get biggerJfc every single comment is GMEGME float is at 35% 

The short on the float is 292% 

That's quite the uphill battle. A battle only a meme stock has the ability to fight. Because it sure as shit won't be earnings.Lol I just had a comment removed for low quality. When has there ever been high quality comments in weekend threads?I’m bagholding a worthless degree 🤡[removed]About to watch two people in their fifties fight while a guy that's almost 50 raps.   

It isn't long before we reach that future where everyone in the nursing home has sleeve tattoos and you can see grandma's barb wire tramp stamp when she bends over to get cookies from the oven.everybody gangsta until ur new gf farts in front of you 😑🔫# If Roy Jones wins by tonight  I'll eat my own shitSnoop Dogg

what year is this lmfaoLmao is a draw the equivalent of theta gang ?Tyson fucked him up bad. how is that a fucking draw[removed]It's almost like sportbooks shouldn't be allowed to sponsor sporting events.looked through 6 month old screenshots of my old positions and i’d be better off now if i had just let them ride lmao that’s a weird feelingPLTR is not a meme stock IMO. Just doing some research earlier and in 2010 there was a press conference held at the White House announcing the success of fighting fraud in the stimulus. VP Joe Biden credited the success to the software, Palantir, being deployed by the federal government. He also announced that the capability would be deployed at other government agencies, starting with Medicare and Medicaid. Guess who is now the president of the United States? PLTR is not some penny stock pump and dump and I'm not sure most of this sub realizes what they are drilling into and it's future potential for long term growth.The 10yr moved down 4% after big dumps in metals & 🐖 coin.

🌈 🐻 are watching.Found out about sports betting so I finally have a way to get dopamine on Saturdays thank godFuck Citron. I hope pltr and nio gangbang them next weekTuscan Raider 🐝 is literally free money, easily +50% if you get in now.

WTF do i buy with my PLTR gainsIs that it? Is that all you can conjure Citron?Taking my anger and aggression out of Citron for hurting my baby PLTR on chest day.Andrew Left is the kind of dude to blame his farts on the dog.They thought PLTR being down today would knock us off our game, cause us to doubt it; meanwhile it’s just made us stronger - PLTR 12/4 40c GangAndrew left waits till after he’s showered to take a messy shitI was on an airplane and some baby was crying his lungs out. Everyone on the plane was miserable, I stood up to see what was going on; turns out it was Andrew left, red faced and out of breath. I asked " What the hell are you doing?"

View daily trending tickers on r/RedditTickers.I'm just gonna say it. Being a bear in a bull market is irresponsible.Man I really gotta start setting stop limits and not hold things from +800% all the way down to expired worthlessI nearly throw up everytime in my mouth when I’m talking to someone about trading, and they say “oh i trade too!” And im like “you do?” And they say “yeah bro i have like 200$ i spent on a stock like two years ago and havent looked at my account since”Ok so a literal scientist who studies vaccines comes on here earlier this week and basically writes what reads like a dissertation on why we should buy calls on Novavax because it its the best vaccine and will win over the others, so I buy calls the same day. The next day it goes up 2%, im up slightly in my calls, get nervous and close out my position because pharma companies are so volatile. Literally today it skyrocketed  22.50%, my calls would have been up 6x. I feel like i want to quit trading now i have toilet paper hands. Why am I like thisGME $20 next week?THC 🐝 APE❌ Master raceIf I don’t get rich off this shit idk how I’m supposed to work retail for 38 more years.

I've done everything I wanted to do for the weekend is it Monday yet?This is the last no-holds-barred autism friendly community I know of. Thanks friends.Just finished The Wolf of Wallstreet, gonna stop by Robinhood and grab something. You guys want anything?this thread really shows how much of a loser you are on the weekends 😞Fuck I am so high and I’m just watching the NASA earth walking feed live on YouTube. It’s unrealTHiC 🐝I have shitcoin just so I can at least experience some net worth volatility to get some adrenaline going on the weekendSomebody start the wsb etf. I don't wanna spend so much time on researching options to make shitty plays, will turn into one of those buy and hold boomer cucks at r/investing if somebody just creates the etf based on the stocks memed here.If citron were a stock, can we all agree it would be okay to short?Good news: PLTR is probably going back up

Bad news: your $5000 all-in play will be insoluble for a month until you break evenWill TSLA 600 print eow?You know I really love the idea of squeezing the shorts out of GME with the homiesMaybe the real tendies were the friends we made along the waySometimes I feel like the only one who actually likes robinhood 🤷‍♀️ I’ve never had them sell any of my contracts or stuff without me wanting them to so idk how that happensWhen someone asks "how do I pick your companies to invest in?". I just think about logging into r/wallstreetbets and dropping 1K on the first post under HOT. Easiest DDWhen I found this sub around this same time last year I thought, "They're right I am never going to invest like that. Dumbasses" now here I am scrolling through this sub for some trading ideas, Max Tendies or die trying.PSA: If your DD doesn't have at least three 🚀 🚀 🚀  I don't want to fucking read it. I only drop money on emoji heavy stocks.A to the P to the X to the TCitron also called TSLA a casino btw, and then after, TSLA tripled!Weekend tip: take long naps to make day go by fasterWould 500K be enough to buy land and build a custom solar powered house off grid by a lake in the Midwest? Kinda wanna get away from the noise and do my own thing, raise some animals, enjoy nature. Maybe go bulk grocery shopping once a month. I find it harder and harder to find something fulfilling as I get older. The dopamine from materialistic goods goes away after a few hours. Relationships are boring.So we're some kind of GME gang now huh?[deleted]GME comment volume is way up, WSB is going to force this move. buy shares with your callsJesus christ, just imagine what Cramer will say next monday with GME24 hours and 23 minutes until futures so I can get my fix on something fluctuatingAlright you autists, you’ve convinced me. I’m gonna throw 50k into GME shares at market open on Monday. Ive seen lots of posts saying how we might get to 500 if this thing squeezes but that seems farfetched to me. For the more conservative people who are in GME, what is a REALISTIC SP that I can aim for to sell my shares? I know if you all say 500 ill never sell and be left bagholding because it ain’t going to 500. 50-150 seems more realistic to me. I welcome all input, jabs, and insults.I want a stress filled life where I’m wearing expensive button up shirts and being irritated by my too hot for me girlfriend cuz I’m the one who’s making millions a year who tf does she think she is voicing her opinion? Is that so much to ask?USA needs to federally legalize online gambling in all 50 states so we can play poker and shit with each other on the weekends for fun

I would looooove some hold em tournaments for like $100 buy inI wouldnt be mad at citron if they actually had some DD. but all they literally said was casino go to 20 like wtf.Which is the better travel destination to bang latinas? Colombia or Brazil?I just want to get to $300k and quit my job. I have big brains to either turn it to $3m or zeroironically have learned so much abt investing by being here. just gotta be able to sift through the impulsive bullshit.GM could stop making real cars tomorrow, invest all its cash in EVs, start making huge losses and stop paying its dividend, and it would rocket 500% 🤔SO EXCITED FOR MONDAYYY : Looking forward to TESLA + NIO + PLTR PUMPPPPPPPJesus christ auto moderator.

He bout to call out Tyson after this matchHoly fuck that was embarrassing.This whole Tyson fight seems like a Chapelle’s Show skitMy girlfriend really gets genuinely mad at me on the reg because she compares herself to my one past relationship. “Did your parents buy your ex a Christmas present every year like they do for me” fuck if I remember I’ve been stoned for 4 years straight I don’t remember what I did 20 minutes ago. The relationship was Fucking 7 years ago. I was 16. It lasted less than a year and I don’t think we even dated over the holiday season.http://www.volokit.com/volostream/boxing-streams/mike-tyson-vs-roy-jones-jr/

Gonna drink tonight...**$DMYT** is a SPAC that is imminently merging with Rush Street Interactive, the largest online casino in the United States. If DraftKings was a good play, RSI is a better one. Q32020 rev was $78 million, up from $17 million Q32019. Revenue growth of 370% with only an 87% increase in marketing spend. Lastly, the guy running the SPAC  Niccolo de Masi knows how to make mobile addicting. It's his thing.

**$NOVS** is a SPAC that is merging with AppHarvest, an indoor farming company. AppHarvest's Board looks fantastic - Martha Stewart, JD Vance, David Lee, etc. They've also gotten a ton of media coverage because their first operational farm is in Appalachia as part of a "bringing green jobs to economically depressed areas" pitch. The SPAC takes care of the biggest roadblock to indoor farming - upfront capital costs. That out of the way it's looking to be really viable and they have 7 more farms in the pipeline.lmao citron? more like shitwrong‼️ 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀I only got into gambling 4 months ago and I realized how boring my life was before.
